Turn on the 12V air pump using the toggle switch. Note: The pressure regulator at the airflow valve should be set to 30PSI.\n\nYou will hear the mechanical locks click into position as the mast is raised. You can turn off the 12V air pump at an intermediate height or after the mast is fully extended. Once the mast is extended turn the airflow valve to the center \"stop\" position.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/c380bbdb-d53b-450e-8586-38bac4e92705/2cc5fe83-4679-4f72-ac8d-eacf8769995f/image?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T085241Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=4e8ff05cce9937c9e9d85d8d8b283aeda7e24f1386e2227371410fb750b25d1c&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nLowering the Mast\n\nYou should not relieve all the pressure and then pull the mechanical lock rings. This will cause the mast to fall and bang against the lower section. This could damage equipment mounted on the mast.\n\nTo lower the mast slowly:\n\nTurn the airflow valve to the \"DOWN\" position.\n\nImmediately pull the bottom lock ring. The mast will begin to collapse.\n\nCharging Batteries from the AC Connection\n\nYou can charge the batteries using 115VAC grid power by following the below process.\n\nConnect an extension cord to the weatherproof AC receptacle on the back of the battery/equipment box.\n\nTurn the battery switch to \"on\"\n\nTurn the AC charge / solar knob to the \"AC charge\" position\n\nConnect the extension cord to the proper 10A AC voltage outlet.\n\nThe battery charging process will start within a few minutes. It should take about 5hrs minimum to fully charge the discharged batteries\n\nCAUTION:\n\nMake sure to not charge or leave the batteries plugged into the AC feed for more than 12 hours.  Doing so might cause damage to the MPPT controller and/or batteries.\n\nRead the supplier instructions\n\nhere\n\nLink: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ChP0Oaviq5UenwbPf5-KCiuj-VhLBTRN\n\nfor more information."

    "text": "This page shows how iHawk integrated with Evercam to link Evercam cameras into their platform.\n\nHow the integration works\n\nThe iHawk app uses its developer account on the Evercam API to get the camera information and location (longitude, latitude, rotation) as well as the Project Name.\n\nnew cameras added to a project will need to be shared with the iHawk developer\n\niHawk matches these data with iHawk projects, then shows the camera markers on their Map.\n\nWhen a user clicks on a camera marker within the iHawk map, the user will be redirected to the camera on the Evercam dashboard in a new window. The user will then be able to access all Evercam features.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/4c075ab1-323e-40ed-bbd9-8be745c3612e/0e56ebe5-c0d0-4dec-869c-1af1580846de/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T085225Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=d3b220749d9251f38bfd0aa40aff20e99b726203b9d5ea8caad992c8d5614b1a&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/4c075ab1-323e-40ed-bbd9-8be745c3612e/10406d5e-aeac-4705-97c7-1db6db2d8c7f/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T085225Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=97920a3836d7013230c854c60772a852e4073d1dc2b871ab05cef3fd3f0f7dd4&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nEndpoints Used\n\nhttps://media.evercam.io/v2/auth/login , to get a token\n\nhttps://media.evercam.io/v2/camera , to gather information about the cameras\n\nAPI Use\n\nThe iHawk-Evercam API is tied to a User ID, as every Evercam user gets a single API ID & Key. That is how we chose to build it. Any API ID from any company would have some method to \"scope\" the API, to decide what it can and can't have access to. Our API IDs are scoped just like users.\n\nTo allow API access to cameras, it should be shared with a user (email address) who has access to all the cameras of the project."

A loader is commonly used to move a stockpiled material from ground level and deposit it into an awaiting dump truck or an open trench excavation.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/c380bbdb-d53b-450e-8586-38bac4e92705/212899d0-e0aa-4fd2-b219-e336cfe527a2/image?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T085222Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=4b05f9067226d3800550e3983334dde3232191718b09effedd9179f691040524&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nBackhoe-loader (ISO 8812)\n\nA backhoe loader, also called a loader backhoe, digger in layman's terms, or colloquially shortened to backhoe within the industry, is a heavy equipment vehicle that consists of a tractor-like unit fitted with a loader-style shovel/bucket on the front and a backhoe on the back. Due to their (relatively) small size and versatility, backhoe loaders are very common in urban engineering and small construction projects (such as building a small house, fixing urban roads, etc.) as well as in developing countries. This type of machine is similar to and derived from what is now known as a TLB (Tractor-Loader-Backhoe), which is to say, an agricultural tractor fitted with a front loader and rear backhoe attachment.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/c380bbdb-d53b-450e-8586-38bac4e92705/066eeb97-6493-4be8-9ef7-510e76f5f8cb/image?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T085222Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=f86b5198e78d89977d9a4e63ab45aeb11b2f45e52082e310c3b09389a7755b9b&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nExcavator (ISO 7135, ISO 15239)\n\nHeavy construction equipment consisting of a boom, dipper (or stick), bucket, and cab on a rotating platform known as the \"house\". The house sits atop an undercarriage with tracks or wheels. They are a natural progression from the steam shovels and are often mistakenly called power shovels. All movement and functions of a hydraulic excavator are accomplished through the use of hydraulic fluid, with hydraulic cylinders and hydraulic motors Due to the linear actuation of hydraulic cylinders, their mode of operation is fundamentally different from cable-operated excavators which use winches and steel ropes to accomplish the movements\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/c380bbdb-d53b-450e-8586-38bac4e92705/5c2566c0-d2da-4495-9fb5-c4dacc412fee/image?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T085222Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=cdf0e9f78bd1fa43c7de90bb3b360a5c591b8844afc9db00a62f1252ea79f64c&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nCompacted excavator (ISO 7135, ISO 15239)\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/c380bbdb-d53b-450e-8586-38bac4e92705/ccafde49-5d75-4c5d-ac2c-ad8e1ff1fd95/image?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T085222Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=053e9b1f67b15771a0375b4bf9400e4b007bd09cd64c92859253695fbd66f083&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nSite-dumper (dumper) (ISO 7132)\n\nA dumper is a vehicle designed for carrying bulk material, often on building sites.

Can you summarize the progress from last week?\"\n\n\"What safety violations did you observe yesterday?\"\n\nReviewing the Response\n\nCopilot will generate a summary and, where possible, provide links to specific footage. Click on these links to validate what the AI has observed.\n\nProviding Feedback\n\nIf the response is helpful, mark it as correct.

Can you summarize the progress for the last 3 days?\"\n\nAsk for Timestamp Links\n\nTo validate what Copilot reports, ask for timestamps to verify the footage. For example:\n\n\"Can you provide the footage from Friday at 2:00 PM to validate this safety hazard?\"\n\nNarrow Down the Focus\n\nIf you’re looking for specific details, such as a particular component or structure, mention it clearly.\n\n\"Please focus on the cylindrical component delivered on the 30th of August.\"\n\nUse Feedback Buttons\n\n:\n\nIf a response is incorrect or irrelevant, use the thumbs-up or thumbs-down buttons to provide feedback and improve Copilot’s accuracy.\n\nIterate Your Questions\n\nIf Copilot’s initial response isn’t accurate, then refine the question and try again.\n\n\"Can you give me more specific details about the concrete work done last Wednesday?\"\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/4bf1c2a7-c871-4f3d-bfe8-98b0e8433621/6ebeb7f8-ad08-4ce7-9cd5-5035de8d2b63/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T085213Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=e8149ed8a534edac6bf3a564f645990c223c53879a73349fd56fa0bf932d122c&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject"

The UI will not change. The change that was done is in the logic of sharing and visibility (access management).\n\nAny new media created from a camera will only be accessible to camera-shared members (people with access to certain cameras). If you go to Media hub and have NO access to a certain camera, you won’t see the media related to that camera.\n\nAny new media from a project-based product (GR/ BIM/Drone/360) will be shared to and can be viewed by all members of the project.\n\nAny new media in the Media Hub will be stored in a project-based way in S3, meaning we can treat the Media Hub as a storage system (i.e. for drone videos, GR reports). We can now have backups to all assets generated by the users.\n\nAdded status of uploading or pending media files\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/3ebb821c-06f1-4e4e-bc0e-3be6c3212157/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T085151Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=1ab1862f558dcf4dca4687b4eb18eb6fb9ea2174c04ffe9b7310f5edaf7c948b&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nBIM\n\nBIM now has a help section with quick tutorials on the features.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/0a016fb4-c8b9-4527-b96c-eb68d56ec684/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T085151Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=d17fbb29a9f376ee77db13508ab3972dace568088446a3a791b3b05f64911736&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nImproved and deployed the Gate Report PDF exporter\n\n360\n\nAdded loading and notification when clicking markers in 360\n\nBIM/ Drone/ 360\n\nDeployed disable tools when not needed\n\nJuly\n\nRemoved all the other tabs (Goodbye overview, plates, events!) and made one unified UI\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/b6ee1245-1090-44e0-8b2c-d652fd063540/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T085151Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=30944c9fdf3dfe048b6aa8e5df363ac1159f9d48707eef1f80e3586804a3a6a6&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nimproved exported table (PDF & CSV) also shows Plate Number and Car Model details\n\nURL updated to show the name and date of the model (in cases where a project has more than one BIM)\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/b6debd20-e31e-445c-8d13-1057d86b6f8e/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T085151Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=eba7b8c0c0e76579efd2032064ab574ac79617707bc69093ca1b4f8ba9f32e3f&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nHelp Section was added at the right navigation panel for the feature tutorials\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/6a1ec6df-5c6d-4a58-9a55-197f3181e191/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T085151Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=a61f195b5e79a43c8a71b9db246c449cd8970b59c082e5ff197d44756ad020e0&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nDrone\n\nWhen using the Volumetrics tool, the scene will default to 2D mode as this is the mode that is recommended when using the tool to get better results.

This means their measuring operations like volume will still be linked to the 2D Digital Elevation Model (a 3D representation of a terrain's surface created from terrain elevation data), and will give similar results to Mesh-based models.\n\nNote: We only support\n\nLAS\n\nformat for Point Clouds.\n\nOur\n\nInspection Tool\n\nis now available.\n\nWhen the\n\nis enabled, you can click on any point and then the Viewer will generate the four (4) closest images related to that point.

    "text": "What does Time-Lapse Pro\n\ninclude as an add-on to my project?\n\nOne\n\nMonthly Professionally Edited Time-Lapse Video - Customizable.\n\nWhat custom capabilities does your Video Team offer with Professional videos?\n\nCleaning The Footage\n\nRemoved Bad Weather and Blurred Images\n\nFootage Stabilisation\n\nColour Correction\n\nGraphic Design\n\nProject Name, Date, Logo\n\nLogo Animations to open and close the video\n\nCustom Text Requirements\n\nCustom Text Design according to Brand Guidelines\n\nCombined Video Sources\n\nMultiple cameras\n\nDrone footage\n\nBIM Integrations\n\nCustom Requirements\n\nAdding Transitions\n\nCrop, Zoom, Frame the Video\n\nBlurring Areas\n\nHide Privacy Shields\n\nDoes\n\nyour standard package include any professionally completed videos?\n\nYes, every standard package receives one timelapse after the project. The recurring monthly or custom videos are now part of our \"Time-Lapse Pro\" subscription package.\n\nAre we getting a monthly touchpoint to replace the monthly timelapse?\n\nAll current users, as well as all new users with a \"Time-Lapse Pro\" subscription, will still receive a monthly touchpoint. All other users will not.\n\nWho can request a time-lapse video?\n\nAt the time of Onboarding, a person is determined by the Project/ Camera owner as the designated person who can assign or request custom time-lapses. If anyone else on the project desires a timelapse, it must be approved by this person first.\n\nHow do I request a special video from the Video Editing Team?\n\nThe preferred method is to submit this form with your request -\n\nTime-Lapse Video Request Form\n\nLink: https://forms.zohopublic.com/Evercam/form/TimelapseFormV2/formperma/1Z5PiEzmFCLDG9K79mI0mAXxyaX8app_0QxuQer0MU4\n\n.\n\nOr you can email\n\nvideo@evercam.io\n\nLink: mailto:video@evercam.io\n\nwith details of the video request in the email body (timeline, special instructions, 3rd party footage, etc).\n\nHow do I receive my monthly video? Where can I find it later?\n\nMonthly professionally edited videos are emailed to all users on a project. Videos can also be accessed at any time in the Media Hub.\n\nI just got my monthly video but realised I want a special video, can I request changes to make it special?\n\nYou can use next month's credit to generate a new special video.\n\nCan I cancel my \"Time-Lapse Pro\" subscription at any time?\n\nWith one (1) month's notice, you can cancel your \"Time-Lapse Pro\" subscription, but you cannot restart it again for any less than 3 month's time.\n\nWith the \"Time-Lapse Pro\" subscription, can I choose not to receive a video this month and get 2 videos next month?\n\nYou receive\n\none video\n\neach month. If a custom video is not requested, you will receive a professionally completed monthly progress update video. We cannot roll out multiple videos in the same month, but you can make your video request from footage from a prior month.\n\nIf you want more than one video per month, you will need to get another Time-Lapse Pro Subscription. One video per subscription.\n\nWill you still make different videos for different social media formats?\n\nOur Video Team can make videos for whichever formats clients desire, either through our subscription model (1 video per month) or through individual purchases.\n\nHow are video requests invoiced?\n\nCustom videos are requested by the Project Representative from the video team via email or through a Zoho Form. The invoice allows for ACH or credit card payments, which should be received before the video is released.\n\nDo you have a schedule for making the videos each month?\n\nYes. The due date is mentioned for each time-lapse in our CRM.\n\nDo you automatically make the TLP videos or do you check in with the client each time before making the monthly video to see if they have any special requests?\n\nWe do not check in with each client, we update the time-lapse with new images every month.  If they have any special requests, they can reach out to the CS manager or the Video Team and we can arrange that. It will be charged for an extra fee or will be the replacement of their monthly video for that month.\n\nWhere are our TLP videos hosted?\n\nOur TLP videos are hosted on\n\nVimeo\n\nand set to\n\nunlisted\n\n, which means that people will only have access to the videos with a direct link. The videos are NOT public. Alternatively, we can add a password to access the video if our customers want to be more cautious."

Check Router\n\n✅ Normal operation: Router LEDs should be solid green\n\n⚠️ If LEDs are blinking alternately: The router isn’t getting a signal. If this is the case then proceed to “fix it”\n\nFix it:\n\nUnplug the router’s black power cable and wait 2–3 minutes\n\nPlug it back in and wait up to 15 minutes for reboot\n\nRemove the SIM card, wipe it clean, and reinsert it\n\nPower cycle again (repeat steps 1–2)\n\n🛠 If it still won’t connect: Contact Support (info below) to check the SIM card’s data plan.\n\n3. Check Camera & LAN Devices 📡\n\nCheck Device LEDs\n\nLook for lights on the camera or inside kit/box (if you’re able to open it)\n\nIf no lights:\n\nTry a different LAN port on the router\n\nCheck if PoE lights are on (if using Power over Ethernet)\n\nTake clear photos of router LEDs and cable connections for Support\n\nStill Not Working?\n\nGather this info before contacting Support:\n\n📍 Router LED status (solid, blinking, or off\n\n🔄 Troubleshooting steps you’ve tried\n\n📸 Photos of: Router LEDs, LAN connections, Charge Controller (for solar setups)\n\n📞 If your camera is still offline and you need Evercam assistance, contact support to submit a ticket and immediate assistance:\n\n📧 Email:\n\nsupport@evercam.io\n\nLink: mailto:support@evercam.io\n\n\n\n📱 WhatsApp: +353 86 084 6525\n\n📅 Book a meeting with a remote tech support specialist immediately (or later):\n\nhttps://book.evercam.io/#/support\n\n🚀"

If BIM models have integrated schedules from your team, setup is easy with just the BIM monthly fee. Otherwise, a manual BIM Sequencing process aligns models with the project schedule.

For best results, include the project 4D timeline.\n\nThe camera coordinates (position on site) should be provided by a surveyor.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/c380bbdb-d53b-450e-8586-38bac4e92705/715e5e35-f5a5-44e2-8f35-c7556382a9d3/image?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084939Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=2ddfdd095c7ac558fd85dc241a29b8e83e0fcf6a22476d9b63f5a169d7381e0e&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nWhat FoV (Field of Vision) do we work with?\n\nWe can do BIM Compare for exterior, interior, or bird's eye view.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/c380bbdb-d53b-450e-8586-38bac4e92705/75423be1-3f3f-4afb-9310-ebe9b2fd26da/image?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084939Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=9bff8fee4e9f0ba0441192d392540fee6f0be9dd6dd9e91435c569b62bf65bbe&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nBIM Compare cannot be done on a 180-degree camera FOV or on a Gate Report camera.\n\nWhat layers do we support?\n\nWe can overlay different layers of the BIM model on the BIM compare feature and you can switch between them. You can send us a federated model with all the layers or separate models for each discipline.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/c380bbdb-d53b-450e-8586-38bac4e92705/052267c6-a6da-4111-8b61-fb5800185890/image?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084939Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=b3a275fdc86140be82028c886d617e1b1b2038ccdd4a1da5efc30f3b9f7e2fd0&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nHow often can we have the BIM realigned due to camera re-positioning?\n\nOne BIM realignment per month is part of the software fee. Any additional realignment (due to changing the position or location of the camera) per month would be charged an extra cost.\n\nWhat are the types of re-alignment that may occur?\n\nBIM - Relocation\n\nThe camera moved to a new Location / new Field of View requiring a complete realignment of the model (which will take 1-3 days estimate)\n\nBIM - Re-alignment (Minor)\n\nThe camera Field of View has changed slightly due to onsite activities (e.g. camera nudged by accident)\n\nBIM - Re-alignment (Major)\n\nThe camera Field of View has changed significantly due to on-site activities or due to a request for a different Field of View from the Client."

    "text": "What is Time-Lapse Creator?\n\nTime-Lapse Creator allows users to create their timelapses within the Evercam platform.\n\nNew Evercam contracts only include 1 professionally edited video as part of our standard package, though you can still purchase them through a subscription model or individually as needed.\n\nWhy is this feature important?\n\nAs part of Evercam's effort to its customers, we are providing more usability with the platform for nearly instant and unlimited time-lapses for increased coordination and collaboration between teams from within the platform.\n\nWhat is the difference between footage from Time-Lapse Creator (TLC) vs Cloud Recordings in the Evercam platform?\n\nRecordings are limited to 1 hour captures at a much higher frame rate for review of work and incidents, without the request of the full frame rate video from Evercam Support.\n\nTime-Lapse Creator (TLC) is focused on team collaboration across longer durations and to show project progress.\n\nCan we brand a Time-Lapse Creator video with our logo?\n\nThere is the capability to upload your logo for the Time-Lapse Creator videos.\n\nCan I make a .gif instead of a video?\n\nOur shortest video length is currently 30 seconds\n\nCan I save my preferred settings to make regular time-lapses?\n\nYou cannot save preferred settings to make regular time-lapses (either by schedule or by duration, length of video, etc).\n\nCan I get the embed code for my time-lapse like the Compare output?\n\nTimelapse Creator will continue to grow and improve through future iterations and this is on our roadmap for this product.\n\nCan I auto-create my timelapse videos within Time-Lapse Creator?\n\nTime-Lapse Creator will continue to grow and improve through future iterations and this is on our roadmap for this product.\n\nCan I have 2 versions of the same video, 1 with the client logo and 1 with the GC logo?\n\nIt is possible both in Time-Lapse Creator, as well as videos purchased through our Video Team at\n\nvideo@evercam.io\n\nLink: mailto:video@evercam.io\n\nCan I remove images from within the\n\nTime-Lapse Creator\n\n?\n\nEvercam's Video Team can remove frames from professionally edited videos, but that feature is not available in Time-Lapse Creator.\n\nIs\n\ngoing to be available in decommissioned cameras?\n\nTime-Lapse Creator is available on decommissioned cameras only upon request.\n\nHow do I share the Time-lapse creator video with the Internal - Project Team?\n\nTime-Lapse Creator offers multiple forms of sharing both internally and externally. Any user on the Evercam platform can use the timelapse URL to review the same timelapse in the Media Hub.\n\nAm I able to request a full frame rate video with Time-Lapse Creator?\n\nYou can always request a full frame rate clip of your video (always recorded at 8 frames a second) by contacting\n\nsupport@evercam.io\n\nLink: mailto:support@evercam.io\n\n, or review at a 1 frame per second with Recordings, but Time-Lapse Creator is specifically for collaboration of longer durations at lower frame rates.\n\nCan I share a video on social media that I've created?\n\nYes, customers can share videos on social media that they have created from their project, as long as it is allowed by their Company or by the Camera/ Project Owner.\n\nWhat is the size of the Time-Lapse video?\n\nTime-lapse videos have a resolution of 1080x720p (HD) with an average of 100-160 MB in size.\n\nTime-Lapse Creator vs. Time-Lapse Pro\n\nDoes Evercam's standard package include any professionally completed videos?\n\n\n\nYes, every standard Evercam package receives one timelapse after the project. The recurring monthly or custom videos are now part of Evercam's \"Time-Lapse Pro\" subscription package.\n\nWhat Time-Lapse tools are included in the standard software? What Time-Lapse tools do I get if I don't purchase\n\nTime-Lapse Pro\n\nas an add-on?\n\nTime-Lapse Creator and one End of Project professional video production are included with the standard offering. If you'd like a monthly time-lapse produced by our video editing team, you'll need to add Time-Lapse Pro to your project order."

Here’s a breakdown to help clarify the term:\n\nCommon Misunderstanding:\n\nA common assumption might be: \"I receive 6 timestamped images from the camera within the span of 1 second.\" This would imply a Cloud Recording clip with timestamps like \"12:00:00, 12:00:00, 12:00:00, 12:00:00, 12:00:00, 12:00:00,\" with each image captured every 10 milliseconds.\n\nActual Scenario:\n\nHowever, what is received is a video with a frame rate of 6 frames per second from Cloud Recordings. The distribution of frames depends on the duration and the number of images chosen for the start and end time of the time-lapse/Cloud Recording clip.\n\nExample Scenario:\n\nIf a user creates a Cloud Recording clip between 12:00 and 14:00, each hour typically contains 360 images. Therefore, a 2-hour period results in 720 images, each with a timestamp 10 seconds apart.\n\nIn a 60-second clip at 6 frames per second, the total number of frames would be 360 (since 6 fps * 60 seconds = 360 frames). This means every other frame is excluded from the Cloud Recording clip.\n\nThe first 6 frames would appear as: \"12:00:00, 12:00:20, 12:00:40, 12:01:00, 12:01:20, 12:01:40.\"\n\nFrame Intervals for Different Durations:\n\n1-hour Cloud Recording Clip:\n\nFrames are 10 seconds apart.\n\n2-hour Cloud Recording Clip:\n\nFrames are 20 seconds apart.\n\n4-hour Cloud Recording Clip:\n\nFrames are 40 seconds apart.\n\n8-hour Cloud Recording Clip:\n\nFrames are 80 seconds apart.\n\n16-hour Cloud Recording Clip:\n\nFrames are 160 seconds apart.\n\n32-hour Cloud Recording Clip:\n\nFrames are 320 seconds apart.\n\n64-hour Cloud Recording Clip:\n\nFrames are 640 seconds apart.\n\nMaximum Frame Distribution:\n\nIn a 64-hour Cloud Recording (~2.6 days), there would be a maximum of 23,040 images. These need to be divided into 360 images for a 60-second Cloud Recording clip. This means we display one image, and then skip 64 images before displaying the next one.\n\nFor example: If the first frame has a timestamp \"12:00:00,\" the next frame would have a timestamp \"12:10:40.\" This interval might be what some users are experiencing.\n\nIn Summary:\n\na 6fps Cloud Recording clip means 6 frames of images between each timestamp second shown at the top-left. In reality, it means 6 images within the video clip’s second window of time."

    "text": "What is Evercam Copilot?\n\nEvercam Copilot is an AI-powered assistant integrated with Evercam’s timeline. It allows users to ask questions in natural language about their construction project data, including images, BIM models, schedules, and more, to generate insights, automate reporting, and detect anomalies.\n\nWhat kind of data can I query using Copilot?\n\nYou can ask Copilot about:\n\nSafety hazards\n\nProject progress\n\nEquipment and manpower productivity\n\nSite conditions\n\nCompliance with regulations\n\nAnd more, based on the captured camera data.\n\nHow accurate are the Copilot responses?\n\nCopilot is designed to assist in analyzing data, but its responses are not always 100% accurate. We recommend validating its outputs, especially for safety reports or critical decisions.\n\nIt’s still an\n\nalpha\n\nfeature and may require refinement based on user feedback.\n\nHow do I provide feedback on Copilot's responses?\n\nYou can use the thumbs-up/down feedback buttons directly in the interface to rate the response. The more specific you are in your feedback, the better Copilot becomes, as this data is used to improve future results.\n\nCan I track progress against project plans with Copilot?\n\nNot yet, but integrating P6 schedules to compare planned progress against observed progress is on the roadmap.\n\nWhat should I do if Copilot generates incorrect or incomplete information? If you notice an error in the information provided by Copilot:\n\nUse the thumbs-down button to mark it as incorrect. Refresh the page and try the query again if the error persists. Report persistent issues to Evercam Support.\n\nCan Copilot analyze and detect safety issues on-site?\n\nYes, Copilot can help identify potential safety risks, such as workers not using PPE or unsafe site conditions. However, always cross-check its analysis with on-site safety guidelines before making any decisions.\n\nHow do I make the most effective prompts when using Copilot?\n\nTo get the best results, see\n\nTips for Effective Prompts\n\nLink: /s/2c280020-8de7-44b6-bf48-aa15a75b3b42/doc/how-to-use-evercam-copilot-dGIKVYL8U0\n\n.\n\nWhat should I do if I encounter a bug or glitch?\n\nIf you experience an issue (e.g., non-functional links, missing data), try refreshing the page first. If the issue persists, report it to Evercam Support. Known glitches are continuously being addressed as Copilot is still in\n\nemail\n\nsupport@evercam.io\n\nWhat is the roadmap for Copilot?\n\nIn the future, Copilot will include features like:\n\nProactive anomaly detection\n\nAutomated reporting across multiple projects\n\nCross-project trends and safety/risk/progress tracking\n\nKeep in mind that Copilot is still evolving and experimental."

Can you summarize the progress from last week?\"\n\n\"What safety violations did you observe yesterday?\"\n\nReviewing the Response\n\nCopilot will generate a summary and, where possible, provide links to specific footage. Click on these links to validate what the AI has observed.\n\nProviding Feedback\n\nIf the response is helpful, mark it as correct.

Include the camera of observed activity, time stamp, manpower, activity observed, equipment, etc.”\n\nSafety-Related Prompts:\n\n\"Identify any safety hazards observed over the past two days.\"\n\n\"Were there any instances of workers missing PPE in today’s footage?\"\n\n\"What fall protection violations, if any, were observed in the footage from last Friday?\"\n\n\"Can you summarize safety risks detected this week?\"\n\nProgress Monitoring Prompts:\n\n\"What percentage of the project is completed based on the footage from this week?\"\n\n\"Compare today's progress to the project's expected timeline.\"\n\n\"What stage of construction is visible in the footage captured last Monday?\"\n\n\"Summarize the progress over the last 7 days and link the footage for validation.\"\n\nEquipment and Utilization Prompts:\n\n\"How many cranes were in use yesterday, and for how long?\"\n\n\"Were any pieces of equipment idle over the last 48 hours?\"\n\n\"How many vehicles entered the site yesterday, and what type were they?\"\n\nObject Detection and Image Insights:\n\n\"When was the cylindrical component delivered, and how long did it take to assemble?\"\n\n\"Was there any visible progress in the construction of the steel structure last Tuesday?\"\n\n\"Identify when the foundation work was completed in the last week’s footage.\"\n\nRisk Identification and Analysis:\n\n\"What high-risk areas were detected on-site based on the footage from the past 3 days?\"\n\n\"Are there any trends in safety incidents observed in the past month?\"\n\nTips for Effective Prompts\n\nTo get the best responses from Copilot, here are a few tips:\n\nBe Specific About Timeframes\n\nWhen asking for progress, safety reports, or equipment usage, specify the time range.\n\n\"What was the progress over the last 3 days?\"\n\n\"Identify hazards observed this week.\"\n\nState Your Role\n\nProviding context about who you are helps Copilot give more relevant responses.\n\n\"I am a construction project manager. Can you summarize the progress for the last 3 days?\"\n\nAsk for Timestamp Links\n\nTo validate what Copilot reports, ask for timestamps to verify the footage. For example:\n\n\"Can you provide the footage from Friday at 2:00 PM to validate this safety hazard?\"\n\nNarrow Down the Focus\n\nIf you’re looking for specific details, such as a particular component or structure, mention it clearly.\n\n\"Please focus on the cylindrical component delivered on the 30th of August.\"\n\nUse Feedback Buttons\n\n:\n\nIf a response is incorrect or irrelevant, use the thumbs-up or thumbs-down buttons to provide feedback and improve Copilot’s accuracy.\n\nIterate Your Questions\n\nIf Copilot’s initial response isn’t accurate, then refine the question and try again.\n\n\"Can you give me more specific details about the concrete work done last Wednesday?\"\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/4bf1c2a7-c871-4f3d-bfe8-98b0e8433621/6ebeb7f8-ad08-4ce7-9cd5-5035de8d2b63/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084933Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=02d0a92bf4ee12f745efb4029b9ca59c73728294a87271b01486b5b8fd726b24&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject"

Both mobile and web users can manually log in with an SSO.\n\nIf you have a Google or Microsoft account, you may use the same login credentials for your Evercam account.\n\nWhen SSO is enabled, users have the option to log in using SSO but can still use their regular username and password if they prefer.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/08182c2f-79b6-4af6-9d1c-79518cc7d930/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084925Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=a0bd051b2244c041bcfaa0476426f8de91496d756463656902c3a6f960884d8e&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/a0e322e0-e629-49b5-b655-19fe1278ede9/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084925Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=a12d5e04206bd56dcf958dd8f9f3f45a85ecb9c9d606ac86d4350176a27ddd97&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nNote:\n\nYour company may request for SSO to be\n\nenforced\n\nfor all company users. In this case, the company’s Microsoft account admin should enable their requests to access Evercam using Microsoft-SSO. When SSO is enforced, it becomes mandatory for users to sign-up and sign-in via SSO, and other login methods are no longer permitted.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/e7a92fc2-1122-41c9-a5bd-3de24aede3ab/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084925Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=d627fb65269d3a2ed971d4eef32046c33c1c56b7c2c0c4234c4160758ccd8af5&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nCompany SSO\n\nEvercam Dashboard supports Open ID Connect standard for SSO. SAML is not supported. SCIM of user and role provisioning is not supported. User account provisioning is done individually when a user login to the dashboard with a company SSO, an invite to a camera or to a project is required to create an account.\n\nWhen company SSO is not enabled, users can login/sign up with an email and password or one of the public SSOs available (Google and Microsoft). Upon an enterprise customer request, Evercam enables custom SSOs for customer domains, ie. password and public SSOs will be blocked for all users @company-domains and the company SSO will be mandatory. In this case, after a user signs up, he/she should be automatically added to the group (Company) based on his/her email. So all users with @xxx.com as an email extension should be included in XXX group and then they can use XXX SSO.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/d9f53950-bdce-4e57-8351-9fa76cc3a861/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084925Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=e5e0b927e2225a603fee3d2984687919d35730eabc34424d5f079a6cae6fdc88&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nSteps to add a new company SSO in Evercam Dashboard\n\n1- Create/register an\n\nOIDC application\n\nin your Identity provider with the following configuration:\n\nParameter\n\nValue\n\nNotes\n\nName\n\nEvercam\n\nIdeally, this is an internal app name in your IDP directory\n\nSupported Account types\n\nDefault: Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)\n\nApp can be restricted to internal accounts within an organization directory.\n\nRedirect_uris (web)\n\nhttps://dash.evercam.io/auth/{id}\n\nhttps://auth.evercam.io/realms/Evercam/broker/{id}/endpoint\n\n{id} should be the company name or domain, ideally one word or a company name in kebab-case. Eg: evercam, evercam-uk, or evercam-engineering…\n\nAuthentication\n\nClient id and Client secret\n\nClient secret will be sent as post\n\nAPI permissions (scopes)\n\nemail\n\nOpenID\n\nprofile\n\nEvercam app will only need to know the user's email, first name and last name.\n\nToken configuration\n\nIn AAD Optional claims\n\nPlease add family_name and given_name claims\n\nEvercam Signup with SSO requires first name and last name\n\nResponse type\n\ncode\n\nAlso known as Oauth2-OIDC authorization code flow\n\n2- Once the app is created in the customer's IDP, It should be\n\nregistered in the Evercam App\n\nto exchange secrets/certificates (this feature will be available soon for Company Admins, meanwhile,\n\nEvercam Support\n\nLink: https://support@evercam.io\n\nor CS team can help to set it up).\n\nRequired information:\n\n\n\nSSO ID used when registering the app (the one populated in redirect_uris)\n\nclient_id and client_secret\n\nAuthorization URL: eg. https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize\n\nToken URL: eg. https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token\n\nLogo: official logo URL or file (optional, can be empty)\n\nList of company domains: the SSO will be linked to all users @ one of the domains. At least one domain is required."

With this new system, a camera does not have to be made Public for the widget to work but its use will be restricted to a specific URL. This applies to Live View, Recordings, BIM Compare and Video Wall.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/1c5a2bf5-fca5-434a-bcdb-764493f27dfc/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084918Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=aa673924d14d04fdc693b7bacd9a868afae740114e13222a0319c4ca14a2b485&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/1a1dd67b-d582-49c9-beb8-f74fa15ed106/20250113-1038-19.0347928.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084918Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=81c501c9da5a1a96ca04020c6474e1dd7bf069f4b4f8810b527a4611797835a7&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nA camera doesn't have to be public to be used in a widget.\n\nEdit Tool is now the Mark-Up Tool\n\nWe’ve renamed the Edit Tool to the Mark-up Tool.

The UI will not change. The change that was done is in the logic of sharing and visibility (access management).\n\nAny new media created from a camera will only be accessible to camera-shared members (people with access to certain cameras). If you go to Media hub and have NO access to a certain camera, you won’t see the media related to that camera.\n\nAny new media from a project-based product (GR/ BIM/Drone/360) will be shared to and can be viewed by all members of the project.\n\nAny new media in the Media Hub will be stored in a project-based way in S3, meaning we can treat the Media Hub as a storage system (i.e. for drone videos, GR reports). We can now have backups to all assets generated by the users.\n\nAdded status of uploading or pending media files\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/3ebb821c-06f1-4e4e-bc0e-3be6c3212157/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084918Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=132428425bcae8c551735860f130c3405af86e26fd3e848806f8e52d32fad700&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nBIM\n\nBIM now has a help section with quick tutorials on the features.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/0a016fb4-c8b9-4527-b96c-eb68d56ec684/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084918Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=c6828b9b95830f653bb79fb4917c5f191a8be9d48cfff624cf80d78e856c3de7&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nImproved and deployed the Gate Report PDF exporter\n\n360\n\nAdded loading and notification when clicking markers in 360\n\nBIM/ Drone/ 360\n\nDeployed disable tools when not needed\n\nJuly\n\nRemoved all the other tabs (Goodbye overview, plates, events!) and made one unified UI\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/b6ee1245-1090-44e0-8b2c-d652fd063540/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084918Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=d5a8e4fa53bf930d563c41c50740e79f43d13bedc42894871e8f874055641542&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nimproved exported table (PDF & CSV) also shows Plate Number and Car Model details\n\nURL updated to show the name and date of the model (in cases where a project has more than one BIM)\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/b6debd20-e31e-445c-8d13-1057d86b6f8e/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084918Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=3673c2c3db7122c4ec87d5dbca3c1eec48339635052e5957efb19455b8c69495&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nHelp Section was added at the right navigation panel for the feature tutorials\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/6a1ec6df-5c6d-4a58-9a55-197f3181e191/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084918Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=ace1c59d4763d074b24b045c7ba7ea8e004fc07c347faeb8c06f006ee13ff9c4&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nDrone\n\nWhen using the Volumetrics tool, the scene will default to 2D mode as this is the mode that is recommended when using the tool to get better results.

Since we won't be using Lidar cameras to make them, the high-level accuracy that Point Clouds are known for, will not be always guaranteed. This means their measuring operations like volume will still be linked to the 2D Digital Elevation Model (a 3D representation of a terrain's surface created from terrain elevation data), and will give similar results to Mesh-based models.\n\nNote: We only support\n\nLAS\n\nformat for Point Clouds.\n\nOur\n\nInspection Tool\n\nis now available.\n\nWhen the\n\nis enabled, you can click on any point and then the Viewer will generate the four (4) closest images related to that point.

    "text": "Scope\n\nThe Backup & Recovery Policy and Procedure shall be applied to all critical information systems and services that fall within the scope of Evercam ISMS.\n\n1. Policy statement\n\nEvercam is committed to ensuring the availability, integrity, and security of our ICT systems and data. As such, regular and reliable backups are essential to mitigate information security risks and threats. Evercam ensures that all essential business information and software are backed up to allow recovery from\n\nDisasters;\n\nData loss;\n\nHardware, media, and system failures;\n\nCyber attacks;\n\nUser errors.\n\nThis policy outlines the procedures and responsibilities for implementing and maintaining a comprehensive backup and recovery strategy in line with our business, legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements.\n\nKey points\n\nBackups are regular;\n\nThe backup is securely stored;\n\nBackup data is retained for a minimum of [1] years;\n\nThe backup process should not adversely affect the other network users;\n\nAll essential (electronic) business information and software is stored on the secure servers;\n\nWhere possible, all paper-based essential business information is scanned and stored on the file servers;\n\nOnly data stored on the networked servers qualify for backup;\n\nData recoveries are regular and can range from a server restore to an individual file;\n\nRetain the ability to recover historic data using obsolete/old backup software.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nAll users have an individual responsibility to ensure that:\n\nEssential Company information and software are stored correctly for backup and in line with its data classification.\n\nTemporary, unnecessary, and duplicate data stored on the network is managed and deleted in a timely manner.\n\nData should only be saved to GDrive or Zoho Work Drive.\n\nAll owners of essential Company information and software are required to ensure that backup arrangements and procedures are in place to safeguard the data.\n\nThe Ops and Devs Departments are responsible for the execution of the backup & recovery procedures and for identifying and reporting any faults, failures, or errors. This includes selecting appropriate backup methods, monitoring backups, and testing recovery processes regularly. The Ops and Devs Departments together with the ISMS team are also responsible for documenting, testing, and maintaining the backup and recovery process in line with the business needs.\n\nThe ISMS team and system administrators are responsible for configuring and scheduling backups according to the defined procedures. They must ensure that backups are completed successfully and regularly review the backup logs for any issues.\n\nData owners are responsible for identifying critical data and applications that require regular backups. They should communicate changes in data retention requirements to the ISMS team and/or Ops/Devs department.\n\nPaper-Based Data\n\nAll Essential Company data whose master copy is in paper format is stored in the following locations:\n\nMaster Copy – securely stored as per its data classification, preferably in a fire safe/cabinet.\n\nPaper Copy – if required, should be stored as per its data classification within the relevant department for general reference.\n\nElectronic Copy – scanned and stored on the file servers in suitable locations depending on data classification.\n\nElectronic-Based Data\n\nIt is the responsibility of each user to ensure that electronic-based data is properly stored to ensure backup and recovery. The appropriate manager is responsible for ensuring that suitable backup & recovery procedures are in place. For a summary of Evercam key electronic system backups refer to the table below.\n\nEvercam core systems backups\n\nSystem\n\nType of data\n\nLocation\n\nFrequency of backup\n\nPerson in charge\n\nZoho People\n\nEmployee data\n\nCloud and Zoho data centres\n\nevery 7 days\n\nDirector of Support\n\nZoho Email\n\nEmployee and customer data\n\nEvercam has an e-discovery policy enabled for email which means that all emails even if they have been deleted are retained. A default retention policy is enabled which states that all emails (including spam/deleted) will be retained for 365 days.\n\nZoho CRM\n\nCustomer data\n\n2 times a month\n\nZoho Analytics\n\nCustomer and employee data\n\nGoogle Drive\n\nCloud and Google data centres\n\nreal-time\n\nGitHub\n\nEvercam Source code\n\nCloud and data centres in USA (Seattle and Northern Virginia)\n\nCTO\n\nHetzner Servers\n\nCustomer data (recordings)\n\nHetzner: Am Datacenter-Park 1, 08223 Falkenstein/Vogtland, Germany\n\nZFS File System is in place Additional backup in edge Evercam kits storage (NVR)\n\nHeroku Servers\n\nAmazon AWS cloud datacenter in Ireland\n\nAWS Servers\n\nCustomer data (users' passwords and credentials, projects, links between cameras and users, and events managed by the Evercam platform)\n\nAWS: Burlington Rd, Dublin 4, D04 HH21, Ireland\n\nDatabase servers on AWS are managed by Heroku, and automatic backups are included in the AWS Plan (SLA).\n\n2. Backup and Recovery Procedure\n\nIn line with our ISMS Evercam follows the Business Continuity Policy and Incident Response Procedure in the event of disasters, data loss, cyber-attacks, hardware, media, and/or system failures etc. To recover from such a situation one must escalate through a series of procedures until a satisfactory restoration is met. As Evercam is a remote-first company this procedure covers the backup and restoration of electronic data held on external servers. Paper-based data is NOT covered by this procedure.\n\nResponsibility\n\nIt is the Technology Lead and Director of Support responsibility to manage, monitor, and audit the backup and recovery procedures for data held on designated servers.\n\n\n\nThe backup and restore procedures are essential to our business. Their primary purpose is to aid in disaster recovery to minimise the amount of data lost after a disaster has occurred e.g.  equipment failure, data corruption, loss of power, etc. Their secondary purpose is to allow the recovery  of specific files requested by individuals. This document outlines the step-by-step procedures for conducting backups and performing data recovery in Evercam. These procedures are designed to ensure the availability, integrity, and security of critical data and systems.\n\nBackup procedure\n\nData Classification and Selection\n\nIdentify and classify data based on its criticality and importance. Prioritise critical systems, databases, source code, and user data for regular backups.\n\nBackup Schedule\n\nPlease refer to the table above (Evercam core systems backups).\n\nBackup Methods\n\nSelect an appropriate backup method: Full Backups: Create complete copies of selected data and systems on a scheduled basis. Incremental Backups: Capture changes made since the last full backup. Perform incremental backups daily.\n\nBackup Execution\n\nSystem administrators will initiate backups using the designated backup software or tools (contacting a dedicated support contact for third-party systems)\n\nEnsure backups are stored in designated backup storage locations\n\nTypes of backup retention: Daily Backups: Retain backups for 7 days. Weekly Backups: Retain backups for 4 weeks. Regularly monitor and manage backup storage to ensure sufficient space.\n\nOffsite Storage\n\nStore a copy of backups off-site in a secure and controlled environment. Maintain a documented inventory of off-site backup storage.\n\nEmail backup\n\nEvercam has enabled eDiscovery, Email Retention, and backup for our Zoho mail server.  An email retention policy and eDiscovery help Evercam to stay compliant with retention laws, handle lawsuits and litigations, avoid witness tampering, and investigate theft of information or contractual disputes.\n\nIn summary, our email backup is:\n\nBy the default retention policy, all emails (including spam/deleted) will be retained for ever.\n\nMails older than the above retention period are considered expired emails and are purged from storage once every 10 days.\n\nBackups have no retention period - emails are stored forever.\n\nEmails from suspended or removed accounts are also retained.\n\nAt any point in time Evercam can launch investigations and place holds on or export emails.\n\nAt any point in time Evercam can recover and expunge emails.\n\nAt any point in time Evercam can restore emails that have been accidentally or purposely deleted.\n\nAt any point in time Evercam can scan all mailboxes for a particular email (for example a phishing email that we know has been received) and delete it from employees' inboxes.\n\nDatabase (server) backup\n\nEvercam database covering users' passwords and credentials, projects, links between cameras and users, and events managed by the Evercam platform is backed up in AWS servers automatically with Heroku as the main interface to manage backups. The availability and durability levels of the AWS backups are guaranteed through SLA.\n\nEvercam follows a two-fold strategy:\n\nThe database is backed up in regular intervals: weekly (managed by Heroku and stored in AWS).\n\nA real-time copy of each second of the last 4 days is generated every 4 days (managed by Heroku and stored in AWS).\n\nThe customer recordings from the site are stored in Hertzner servers. To ensure the backup full frame recordings can be retrieved from hard drives and NVR installed locally in the Evercam kit on site. These can be accessed remotely to retrieve the necessary data. To monitor the performance Evercam relies on Grafana as a tool to query and visualize logs and metrics. It allows us to control our hard drives’ performance metrics remotely. Grafana is used daily by our Dev team. Evercam relies also on Prometheus as a system that alerts DevOps (via email) about issues and irregularities (when a metric is going above/beyond a threshold) when it comes to our hard drives. Prometheus is used to collect metrics from servers (CPU, Memory, Network, and Storage).\n\nEmergency response\n\nIn case of emergency (hardware issues such as loss of a hard drive) the procedure is to email Hetzner support system\n\nsupport@hetzner.com\n\nLink: mailto:support@hetzner.com\n\nCode backup\n\nEvercam source code is stored on Github with Cloud servers located in the USA (Seattle and Northern Virginia). Regular automated backups of code repositories are performed in real-time. Backups must be encrypted during transmission and storage to protect sensitive code and data from unauthorised access. Periodic restoration tests should be conducted to ensure the viability of backups for recovery purposes.\n\nDevelopers are responsible for committing their code to the designated repositories and ensuring that the code is up-to-date. Regular commits reduce the risk of code loss.\n\nBy adhering to this Code Backup Policy, we aim to maintain the integrity of our code repositories and enable swift recovery in the face of data loss or other unforeseen events. This policy underscores our commitment to data security, continuous availability, and the overall success of our development efforts.\n\nRecovery Procedures\n\nData Restoration\n\nIn case of data loss or system failure, follow these steps for data recovery: Identify the data or systems to be restored based on the nature of the incident. Reach out to the dedicated support contact assigned to a given system. The contacts are listed in the\n\nEvercam Business Continuity Plan Contact Sheet\n\nLink: /s/2c280020-8de7-44b6-bf48-aa15a75b3b42/doc/business-continuity-plan-contact-sheet-Z1YsG0mYCN\n\nThe dedicated contact will access the most recent backup that contains the required data. The dedicated contact will restore the data using the designated recovery procedures and tools. Verify the restored data for accuracy and integrity.\n\nDisaster Recovery\n\nIn the event of a larger-scale disruption, such as a system-wide failure or disaster, follow these steps: Activate the company's disaster recovery procedure. Reach out to the dedicated support contact assigned to a given system. The contacts are listed in the\n\n. They will: Retrieve the necessary off-site backups and hardware. Restore critical systems and data according to the disaster recovery plan. Perform testing to ensure the functionality and integrity of recovered systems.\n\nTo identify the best recovery methods to use, the following data is required: When did the problem occur? Is the data stored in a general area backed up? When was the last backup?\n\nDepending on the answers above, the best recovery method is applied. Time is important and the quicker the loss/corruption is found, the quicker the recovery will be.\n\nTesting and Monitoring\n\nBackup Testing\n\nRegularly perform test restores from backups to ensure data recoverability. Document and address any issues identified during testing.\n\nBackup Monitoring\n\nContinuously monitor backup logs for any failures or errors. Investigate and resolve backup issues promptly.\n\nDocumentation and Reporting\n\nMaintain comprehensive documentation of backup and recovery procedures, including schedules, methods, and test results. Provide regular reports to management on the status of backups, recoveries, and any incidents.\n\nTraining\n\nEnsure that system administrators are trained on the proper execution of backup and recovery procedures. Conduct regular training sessions and refresher courses as needed.\n\nReview and Update\n\nRegularly review and update this procedure to reflect changes in technology, data needs, and company requirements.\n\nCreated by: Head of Compliance (ISMS team)\n\nCreation date: 08.08.2023\n\nLast modification date: 21.11.2024\n\nDocument approver: Chief Technology Officer"

    "text": "Purpose\n\nThe purpose of the audit log management policy is to create, store, and analyse log files with the goal of detecting and responding to any suspicious or abnormal events that may occur within the organisation. It also allows for the prioritising, and remediating of any potential vulnerabilities in enterprise systems and software. The audit log management policy provides the processes and procedures for ensuring logs are created and properly analysed. This policy applies to all departments and all assets connected to the Evercam network.\n\nResponsibility\n\nThe Engineering (Eng) department is responsible for all log management functions. Specifically, administrators are responsible for configuring the correct devices to generate, store, and transmit logs. Eng is responsible for informing all users of their responsibilities in the use of any assets assigned to them, such as applying updates in a regular manner or restarting their systems. All enterprise assets are required to comply with the enterprise audit logging procedures.\n\nPolicy\n\nGeneration\n\nAn enterprise-wide strategy must be developed to establish and maintain an audit log process.\n\nThis strategy must be documented.\n\nDocumentation must be updated annually, or when significant changes have occurred.\n\nThe contents of logs must be specified within the secure configuration policy.\n\nAudit logging must be enabled on all enterprise assets, as is practical.\n\nAudit logs must not be disabled on enterprise assets.\n\nTransmission\n\nProcedures must be developed to move logs from enterprise assets to an audit log datastore.\n\nLogging system\n\nLink: /s/2c280020-8de7-44b6-bf48-aa15a75b3b42/doc/logging-system-VfMgmewDxP\n\n(Engineering docs) details the procedures made to move logs from enterprise assets to a remote datastore.\n\nStorage\n\nAll enterprise assets (servers, apps, edge devices) generate logs in json format locally.\n\nPromtail\n\nLink: https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/send-data/promtail/\n\nis used to collect local logs from different sources (system, apps, files) and push them to logs data store.\n\nLoki\n\nLink: https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/\n\n, a log aggregator, ensures logs management, querying, storage, and retention…etc\n\nSufficient storage space must be allocated for audit logs for the period of time required for analysis and retention.\n\nSufficient space must be allocated to store audit logs on all enterprise assets.\n\nSufficient space must be allocated to store audit logs on any centralised audit log datastore.\n\nReview and Analysis\n\nAll high severity events must be acted upon in accordance with the audit log management process.\n\nRetention timeframes for audit logs should be in accordance with the enterprise data management process.\n\nIn general, Logs are saved for three months. For querying logs performance, only the last month logs are available for review and analysis. the previous 2 months logs are saved in archived state.\n\nAccess controls must be used to prevent audit logs from being modified in an unauthorised manner. The only interface to query logs is by using Grafana (Access control implemented). Once Logs are stored, they can’t be modified.\n\nSome specific audit logs, like Camera logs, are required to be saved for longer and to be available for review and analysis while the project is in progress. These logs are available in Admin app for Evercam employees only.\n\nDisposal\n\nAll audit logs must be stored for a period of time specified by the audit log management process.\n\nArchived logs can be available for analysis.\n\nDisposal of audit logs should be in accordance with the enterprise data management process.\n\nSummary of Evercam Log management Systems\n\nLog management system\n\nPurpose (Use case)\n\nWho reviews it (Teams)\n\nReview process\n\nRetention period\n\nGrafana\n\nIt is a platform for monitoring, visualisation, and alerting.

    "text": "Purpose\n\nThe protection of our development environment and the software services that we provide is crucial to meeting the requirements of our business, and of our customers. Ensuring that security is integral to our development process helps us to minimise the possibility of introducing vulnerabilities into our development systems and software, reducing the risk of data breaches or service unavailability. Management are committed to the security of our application services, and have developed and approved this secure development policy in line with the requirements of the ISO 27001 standard for information security, and our organisation's business requirements. This document sets out the approved secure development policy so that it can be clearly communicated to all employees, contractors, and third-parties who have responsibilities for developing, managing, and maintaining our software and development environment.\n\nScope\n\nThis policy shall apply to the development and administration of all software applications that fall within the scope of our organisation's ISMS.\n\nAudience\n\nAll employees, contractors, and third-parties who have responsibility for the design, development, administration, and monitoring of our development environment and software applications shall adhere to this Secure Development Policy. These include, but are not limited to, the following roles:\n\nDevelopment team leads\n\nApplication architects\n\nApplication developers\n\nSoftware engineers\n\nProject managers\n\nSystem administrators\n\nNetwork engineers\n\nApplication development service providers\n\nCloud services providers\n\nCloud security architects\n\nInformation security analysts\n\nSystem owners\n\nSystem testers\n\nFor the purposes of this document, employees, contractors, and third-parties who carry out these roles shall be collectively referred to as \"developers\".\n\nCommunication\n\nThis Secure Development Policy shall be communicated to all employees and agency staff as part of the relevant department training programme, and periodically following any changes to the policy. All contractors and third-parties providing development services or involved in development projects which interact with our services shall be provided with a copy of this policy as part of the process for contracting services. Contractors and third-parties shall be re-issued with updated versions of this policy periodically, and following any changes.\n\nDisciplinary Process\n\nWhere a developer performs an activity or activities in breach of this Secure Development Policy, they shall be subject to the disciplinary process documented in the\n\nHR Manual\n\n, or the applicable service contract.\n\nImprovement\n\nManagement is committed to the continual improvement of our Secure Development Policy, and shall review this document on an annual basis, or whenever an independent review of our organisation's ISMS reveals a non-conformance or opportunity for improvement. The Management Review shall determine if this policy continues to meet the requirements of our organisation.\n\nManagement also endeavours to plan our business operations so that our applications are not misused, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is done by identifying and assigning separate duties and responsibilities to guard against misuses such as fraud, or malicious insider activities, etc. Where a developer identifies potential conflicts or misuse due to improper planning and assignment of duties, developers should raise their concern immediately with their line manager, or the ISMS Manager.\n\n1. Maintaining Security Awareness\n\nOur organisation recognises the importance of maintaining robust security measures to protect our applications and services against potential vulnerabilities and threats. While malicious attackers constantly seek to exploit weaknesses in software and web-based systems, we are committed to implementing proactive measures to mitigate these risks.\n\nTo achieve this goal, developers are encouraged to stay informed about secure coding practices and emerging threats. While adherence to specific training programs such as the OWASP Top 10 standard is beneficial, we understand that different developers may have varying schedules and learning preferences\n\nKey Points:\n\nAwareness and Education: Developers are encouraged to stay informed about secure coding best practices through a variety of sources, including relevant security alert feeds, blogs, forums, and industry publications.\n\nContinuous Learning: Developers should regularly review security alerts and notifications to assess their potential impact on our development environment and applications.\n\nTraining and Development:  In addition to completing the annual formal security awareness training exercise, developers are encouraged to explore supplementary learning opportunities such as self-study options, workshops, or online courses to further their skills in application security. Active engagement in professional development activities is essential for staying abreast of evolving security practices.\n\nDocumentation: While HR may retain records of certain training activities as part of the employee training program, developers are advised to maintain documentation of any external security training they pursue and submit the documentation to HR. This includes certificates of attendance or completion obtained from sources outside the organisation's provided training. Keeping thorough records and sharing them with HR ensures transparency and completeness in documenting ongoing professional development efforts related to security training.\n\nCollaboration: Developers should maintain open communication with relevant service and technology providers to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities or issues related to the applications and services they work with.\n\nData Handling and Retention: Developers should regularly review and adhere to our\n\nPolicy: Data Handling & Retention Guidelines\n\nLink: /s/2c280020-8de7-44b6-bf48-aa15a75b3b42/doc/policy-data-handling-retention-guidelines-RNuAPUoc9X\n\nto ensure compliance with our requirements for the protection and retention of data.\n\n2. Secure Development Approach\n\nNo matter which software development methodology is used, our organisation requires that information security considerations and secure coding practices are embedded into the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This section provides guidance for how security is considered at each stage of the SDLC. The policies documented should not be considered exhaustive, and developers may identify additional methods for implementing controls.\n\nThe below diagram illustrates how security considerations are typically included throughout the SDLC:\n\ngantt\n    title Security Considerations in SDLC Diagram\n    dateFormat off\n    section SDLC\n    Speification           :a1, 2024-01-01, 1M\n    Architecture                 :a2, after a1 , 1M\n    Implementation         :a3, after a2 , 1M\n    Test & Review          :a4, after a3 , 1M\n    Build & release        :a5, after a4 , 1M\n    \n    section Security checks\n    Identify personas      :2024-01-01  , 1M\n    Access control compliance    :2024-01-01 , 40d\n    Data validation    :after a1 , 1M\n    Error handling    :after a1 , 1M\n    Logging    :after a1 , 1M\n    Secure Code versionning workflows    :after a2 , 2M\n    Required peer reviews   : after a2, 2M\n    Required change approvals  : after a2, 2M\n    Automated checks and tests    :after a2 , 2M\n    Vulnerability scans    :after a3 , 1M\n    Automated pipelines    :after a4 , 1M\n    Secure creds vault :after a4 , 1M\n    Isolated environments    :after a3 , 2M\n    Tests acceptance    :after a4 , 1M\n    Deployment alerts    :after a4 , 1M\n\n2.1 Defining Requirements\n\nWhen determining the functionality of the proposed new service or service update, security considerations must be included as part of the business requirements. The following policies shall apply:\n\nDevelopers shall ensure that the requirements for information security documented in our Information Systems Security Policy are adhered to.\n\nDevelopers shall ensure that the data protection principles and retention requirements set out in our Data Handling & Retention Guidelines are adhered to.\n\nDevelopers shall ensure that the data and assets impacted are identified, recorded to our Critical Asset Register where necessary, and assessed to determine their value and appropriate handling and access requirements.\n\nDevelopers shall ensure that our Change Control Procedure has been followed for normal, major, and emergency changes. Following our requirements for change control shall ensure that appropriate risk and data protection assessments are conducted, along with identifying applicable legal and regulatory considerations.\n\nWhere changes are classified as standard changes, developers shall ensure suitable peer review and acceptance controls are built into the development workflow.\n\nDevelopers should ensure that they consider the availability and capacity requirements of proposed new services or service updates.\n\nWhere necessary, developers should consider using security sprints as part of the development approach.\n\n2.2 Security in Design\n\nWhen developing the software service, feature, or application, developers shall ensure security requirements are included in the design stage. By leveraging secure engineering principles, developers will reduce the risk of our services and applications being compromised by malicious attackers. This section documents secure engineering principles that developers should include in the design stage of development. Developers should ensure that they are appropriately trained to understand and implement these principles. Secure engineering principles include, but are not be limited to:\n\nPrinciple\n\nDescription\n\nData validation\n\nData validation may include input validation and output encoding. Whitelisting of characters and translation of characters to safe or approved forms provides protection against attacks such as XSS, XFS, SQL injection, buffer overflow, etc.\n\nData minimisation\n\nData collected, processed, and/or generated by the service, feature, or application shall always be limited to what is absolutely necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. For example, where application logs are generated to identify events about capacity, it may be unnecessary to automatically include user names and their device information in the log data.\n\nAuthentication\n\nAppropriate authentication mechanisms shall always be used unless the resources or webpages are intended for public access. Requirements for password management are set out in our Information Systems Security Policy, and shall be implemented for all services and users.\n\nWhere users of a service, feature, or application will be required to configure their own authentication policies as part of a shared responsibility model, appropriate controls and tools shall be developed and provided so that authoritative users can securely control and manage user accounts.\n\nAuthorisation\n\nAuthorisation controls shall be used to ensure only authorised services and users have access to application resources, accounts, data, and code. Authorisation should be re-validated periodically to ensure access privileges have not changed.\n\n\n\nWhere users of a service, feature, or application will be required to perform their own access management as part of a shared responsibility model, appropriate controls and tools shall be developed and provided so that users can set and monitor their required levels of access, and ensure access privileges are correct.\n\nSecure by default\n\nDefault settings for services, features, or applications shall always prioritise user or organisational security so that data is automatically protected. This means that users shall be required to take little or no action to ensure the security of their data, and any automatic sharing of data shall be limited to only what is necessary. For example, a user profile may contain personal contact details, education information, and leave status data. Where only the sharing of contact details is necessary for the proper operation of the application, developers shall not:\n\nMake input fields mandatory for education and leave status information\n\nShare any of that data by default\n\nThe user should have to opt-in, or enable, any additional sharing features, as required. Users should not have to opt-out of, or disable, the sharing of data.\n\nSession management\n\nSession management controls help to prevent user impersonation and compromise of session IDs. Session management controls may include:\n\nSetting of security flags and secure paths for cookies\n\nSession and session ID expiry\n\nPreventing session re-activation and implementing correct session logout behaviour\n\nSetting correct HTTP referer controls to filter sensitive information\n\nFail secure\n\nWhere control mechanisms such as authentication, access control, encryption, and system exceptions may fail, they should not fail in an insecure way. For example, where authentication fails due to an exception, the authentication request should be denied.\n\nCryptographic techniques\n\nEncryption and cryptographic keys used to protect data shall meet the requirements for cryptographic control as documented in our Information Systems Security Policy, or where not specifically documented in our policy, they shall comply with the FIPS 140-2 or equivalent standard (\n\nhttps://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules\n\n)\n\nWhere users of a service, feature, or application will be required to implement their own cryptographic controls as part of a shared responsibility model, legal, or regulatory requirement, appropriate controls and tools for managing encryption shall be developed and provided to users, where possible. This may include the ability to apply data masking techniques to different types of data, or data storage locations, as appropriate.\n\nError handling\n\nErrors shall be handled securely. Where errors occur, information about the error, and sensitive information such as account and system details, shall not be disclosed in inappropriate ways, such as being displayed back to the user, or included in logs.\n\nLogging\n\nLogging should contain the relevant event data such as validation failures, system exceptions, unexpected changes to data, copying and export of sensitive information, etc. Log data should also be protected from unauthorised access in line with our Information Systems Security Policy.\n\nFile management\n\nParameter and validation checks should be set for the management of files to prevent upload of unauthorised or unexpected files, etc.\n\nThreat modelling\n\nAssists with analysing application components, and identifying and categorising possible threats and requirements for mitigation. This shall also assist in determining security and privacy testing for the service or application so as to proactively secure data and prevent risks from occurring.\n\nData lifecycle protection\n\nMechanisms for the protection of data shall be implemented with consideration for the full lifecycle of the data to ensure it is appropriately protected from the point of collection to destruction.\n\n2.3 Secure Development\n\nWhen carrying out development activities, developers shall not only ensure that the security requirements identified from the design stage are implemented in the development stage, but that necessary security controls are applied to protect the development process and the development environment. Secure development requirements include, but are not limited to:\n\nEnsuring that application, development, and system architecture is secure, including appropriate network, access, and asset protection controls as documented in our Information Systems Security Policy.\n\nEnsuring that changes are controlled in line with our documented Change Control Procedure.\n\nEstablishing approved procedures for development which includes controlled workflows, secure code review, acceptance testing, and providing appropriate developer training.\n\nEnsuring that third-party code such as open-source software is not modified or changed unless it is considered necessary. Modifications to third-party code may introduce unexpected vulnerabilities, and may not be permitted by the third-party.\n\nEnsuring logging and monitoring is implemented in line with our Information Systems Security Policy.\n\nEnsuring all necessary information such as system configuration data, code, test data, etc. is identified and backed up in line with our Backup and Recovery Policy & Procedure.\n\nEnsuring that access to source code is appropriately restricted in line with access control policies documented in our Information Systems Security Policy. Restricting access to source code shall also include ensuring appropriate access controls are enforced for the development tools and software libraries used to manage and produce the source code. Where required, developed source code may be held in escrow.\n\nEnsuring that development, test, and production environments are separated. Where the environments are not properly separated, differences in access and change control procedures between them may result in vulnerabilities being introduced.\n\nEnsuring that data used for development and testing purposes is either sanitised or protected in line with data protection requirements. Where live/production data is used in a development or test environment, the data may become accessible to persons who would not normally be authorised to view the data, resulting in potential data breach. Also, where a test or development environment may be compromised due to an undiscovered security weakness, this may lead to a breach of the live/production data.\n\n2.4 Testing\n\nTo ensure that the identified security controls are implemented correctly, and to reduce the likelihood of security vulnerabilities going undetected, developers shall plan and carry out security testing in the testing stage. Security testing requirements include, but are not limited to:\n\nCarrying out secure code review by peers in line with the development process.\n\nCarrying out any security testing identified as part of threat modelling exercises in the design stage.\n\nVulnerability scanning of the application to identify known application vulnerabilities and other security vulnerabilities such as open ports, deprecated SSL/TLS certificates, etc.\n\nPenetration testing should be conducted bi-annually to ensure thorough examination of the environment for security weaknesses, including but not limited to input validation testing, user enumeration, and system hardening. The results of these penetration tests should be presented to the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), along with a report identifying vulnerabilities and shortcomings revealed by the tests. The CTO is responsible for reviewing these findings and creating a remediation plan to address them. Additionally, the CTO should oversee the implementation of the rectification procedures or actions to ensure the security of the environment is maintained at an optimal level.\n\nCarry out appropriate acceptance testing of any new or modified information systems in line with our Change Control Procedure.\n\n2.5 Deployment\n\nWhen deploying new or modified software services, features, or applications, developers shall ensure that security requirements are built into the deployment stage of the process to protect our information systems and code. Security requirements for deployment include, but are not limited to:\n\nEnsuring that secure code review by peers has been performed prior to deployment.\n\nEstablishing approved procedures for controlling the deployment pipeline which may include approval and code verification controls.\n\nEnsuring deployments are made only from trusted code and not pulled from untrusted sources.\n\nEnsuring any credentials with elevated privileges used to run code are protected from unauthorised exposure and use.\n\nEnsuring required access controls in line with our Information Systems Security Policy are properly implemented to prevent unauthorised access.\n\nEnsuring that deployments are not scheduled immediately prior to periods of unavailability, such as weekends or leave. Where unforeseen issues arise as a result of the deployment, resolution times may be impacted due to the unavailability of developers.\n\nEnsuring deployments that may impact data security are documented and communicated in line with our Data Handling & Retention Guidelines, where necessary. This will ensure data processing activities remain transparent to users.\n\nThe incident response procedure is integrated within each stage of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), ensuring it remains current and responsive. Significant software changes trigger an update to the incident response procedure and corresponding exercises to validate its effectiveness.\n\n2.6 Post change validation\n\nIf deployed changes affect system availability, rollback mechanisms are in place to restore functionality. The team must adhere to these rollback protocols to minimise disruptions and maintain system stability.\n\nRollback protocol\n\nIn the event of a security issue, vulnerability, or problem arising from a new deployment, such as a critical bug, the rollback protocol must be followed to ensure system stability and data integrity:\n\nRevert Deployment:\n\nImmediately deploy the last known working version or branch of the application to restore normal operations.\n\nData Structure Rollback:\n\nIf the deployment included a data migration, the data structure must be reverted to its previous state. This should follow the pre-defined migration rollback plan to ensure consistency and prevent data corruption.\n\nLogging and Notification:\n\nDocument the issue, and steps taken for rollback, and notify the relevant stakeholders, including security and development teams.\n\nRoot Cause Analysis:\n\nConduct a post-rollback review to identify the root cause of the issue and prevent recurrence. See\n\nRoot Cause Analysis\n\nLink: /s/2c280020-8de7-44b6-bf48-aa15a75b3b42/doc/root-cause-analyses-rgJMMM4gF5\n\n3. Outsourced Development\n\nWhere it is necessary to outsource development activities to a contractor or third-party provider, our organisation requires that the software, features, and applications developed adhere to our requirements for quality and security. As documented in the communications section of this policy, contractors and third-parties involved in development activities shall be issued with a copy of this document as part of the process for contracting services.\n\nAll third-parties involved in development activities shall be managed in line with our Supplier Due Diligence Policy which sets out our requirements for auditing, data agreements, information security controls, technology supply chain, and intellectual property.\n\nCreated by: Head of Compliance (ISMS team)\n\nCreation date: 01.08.2023\n\nLast modification date:\n\n15.11.2024\n\nDocument approver: Chief Technology Officer"

    "text": "Service Level Agreement\n\n1. Overview\n\nThis agreement outlines the parameters of all services as they are mutually understood by the Customer and Evercam. This Agreement remains valid until superseded by a revised agreement mutually endorsed by the stakeholders.\n\n2. Service Scope\n\nEvercam services can be categorised as remote services, or site operations services.\n\nSupport Category\n\nDescription\n\nExamples\n\nRemote Support\n\nIssues that can be solved remotely.\n\nTroubleshoot Offline Camera Events\n\nFootage retrieval requests\n\nSoftware maintenance and updates\n\nRemote camera configuration (commissioning)\n\nSite Ops Support\n\nIssues that generally require a site visit.\n\nInstallation\n\nService/Maintenance Visits\n\nCamera Relocations\n\nDecommissioning\n\n3. Camera Status: Definitions\n\nOnline\n\n: The camera is functioning as expected.\n\nOffline\n\n: The camera is offline and has not been reported to or acknowledged by Evercam.\n\nOffline (Scheduled)\n\n: The camera is on an agreed power schedule whereby the camera will be offline and inaccessible during predetermined timeframes. During the periods that a camera is scheduled to be offline, the camera will not record either to the cloud or locally.\n\nUnder Maintenance\n\n: The camera is offline and is being investigated by the Evercam Support team.\n\nUnder Maintenance waiting for site visit\n\n: The camera is offline, and the case has been transferred to the Site Operations team.\n\n4. Customer Responsibilities\n\n4.1 The Customer shall allocate personnel with the sufficient time, resources and permissions to ensure the successful installation and operation of the Devices and Evercam Platform on the Customers information technology and computer infrastructure (the “\n\nCustomer IT Systems\n\n”). Additionally, the Customer will appoint a designated on-site representative for each Customer site on which the Services are being provided, who will oversee and liaise with Evercam on the successful installation, operation and maintenance of the Evercam Platform and Devices at such site.\n\n4.2 Communication with any third party for setup or operational purposes of the Customer IT Systems remains the responsibility of the Customer. Any Customer-nominated representatives are assumed to have the necessary authority and competence to manage the installation and operation of the Evercam Platform and Devices on the Customer IT Systems.\n\n4.3 Where Evercam provides Installation Services, the Customer will ensure that the Device mounting locations have safe and unobstructed access and power availability and the Customer has obtained all necessary consents and approvals for the installation of any such Devices.\n\n4.4 The Customer will ensure a stable and reliable power supply to the Devices, either from mains electricity or a generator connection. If a generator is used, Evercam and the Customer will mutually agree upon a power schedule in order to ensure the Devices can operate and Services can be provided (the “\n\nPower Schedule\n\n”). The Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that the generator power source supports the agreed schedule. In the case of solar-powered Devices, the Devices will only function as per the agreed Power Schedule subject to adequate conditions. The Customer will ensure that the solar panels and batteries remain undamaged and are not moved without prior consultation with Evercam. Additionally, the Customer will ensure that the solar panels are free from debris, dust, and obstruction. The Customer acknowledges that solar power has limitations, such as an approximate 12 hour maximum schedule and reduced operation during periods of low sunlight\n\n4.4.1 If any Device’s recording capabilities are limited due to weather or other conditions on-site, intervention may be required from the Customer      or from Evercam to ensure operability and same shall be carried out at the Customer's expense\n\n4.4.1 Evercam recommends a stable VAC (main electrical) power source for reliable camera performance. Alternative power sources, such as      solar or generators, introduce reliability risks that may impact uptime, service continuity, and potentially void hardware warranties due to inconsistent power supply.\n\n4.5 The Customer will promptly inform Evercam of any on-site changes that may impact the performance of the Devices and Services, or obstruct the Field of View of the Camera. The Customer will not tamper with or move the Devices without prior notification to Evercam. Reasonable measures shall be taken by the Customer to prevent accidental or intentional interference with Devices. Any such incidents may compromise the Evercam Platform’s functionality, requiring on-site intervention from the Customer or from Evercam to ensure operability and same shall be carried out at the Customer's expense.\n\n4.6 Prior to the calibration of the ‘Gate Report Camera’, the Customer and Evercam will mutually agree upon the Gate Report Camera's position, configuration and field of view. Any alterations to these agreed-upon parameters may compromise the Gate Report Camera's functionality, requiring on-site intervention from the Customer or from Evercam to ensure operability and same shall be carried out at the Customer's expense.\n\n4.7 Where the BIM model integration functionality of the Evercam Software Services is enabled for the Customer’s use, the Customer will provide accurate and up-to-date BIM models. Changes to these BIM models or camera repositioning may disrupt BIM Model functionality, necessitating model re-alignment or on-site intervention by either the Customer or from Evercam to ensure operability and same shall be carried out at the Customer's expense.\n\n4.8 Where any Devices are hosted by, at or on a third-party building, Evercam does not guarantee continuous physical hosting of any such Device, and delays may occur if access to the third-party host building is required to resolve any issues with such Devices. Evercam is not responsible for any interruptions in a third party building’s hosting any such Devices or delays in accessing the host building, and disclaims responsibility for any consequences of this reduced access (including but not limited to any disruption to the Services).\n\n4.9 All Data SIM cards provided by the Customer must meet the specifications communicated by the Evercam Operation Team for the specific application and region.\n\n4.10 Evercam is not liable for offline events, hardware damage to Hardware or Devices, or site visit requirements resulting from natural disasters, such as adverse weather conditions, fires, national emergencies, pandemics, strikes, labour or equipment shortages, or other business interruptions beyond Evercam's control\n\n4.11 Unless otherwise agreed, the Customer is responsible for monitoring camera uptime and notifying Evercam of any issues. In the event of an uptime issue, the Customer must submit a service ticket to request troubleshooting assistance in accordance with clause 7.\n\n5. Uptime Commitment\n\n“Uptime” is the percentage of total possible minutes the Evercam Software Platform was available within a given calendar quarter. This does not include camera hardware uptime. Evercam is committed to maintaining 99% Evercam software platform uptime. Evercam may periodically schedule maintenance periods in order to maintain the integrity and performance of the Evercam Platform. Evercam will notify the Customer of any such periods as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\n6. Offline events and common resolutions\n\nMost camera offline events can be resolved remotely with the assistance of the onsite customer representative. Below is a list of common faults and resolution steps:\n\nOffline Event\n\nSymptoms\n\nResolution steps\n\nLoss of Power\n\nCamera is completely offline, no power indicators.\n\nVerify power supply to the camera. Ensure the power source is functioning and connections are secure. Restart the power source if necessary.\n\nLoss of broadband connectivity\n\nCamera is offline, no network connection detected.\n\nReboot network device remotely.\n\nCheck network cables and connections.\n\nHardware Failure\n\nCamera is offline and not responding.\n\nReboot remotely.\n\nCheck cables and connections.\n\nConfirm Camera & NVR are connected.\n\nOnsite damage to Hardware or Cabling\n\nCamera is offline and not responding, or has limited functionality.\n\nVisual inspection & photos from on-site representative.\n\nVerify that the lens is clean and the view is unobstructed.\n\nIdentify which devices are disconnected or damaged and communicate to Evercam support team.\n\n7.

Timely cooperation from the customer is critical to meet resolution commitments, delayed responses from the customer may extend resolution times.\n\n7.3. If a site visit by a third-party is required due to reasons within the Customer’s control, such as disruptions to the power supply or physical damage to the equipment, all associated costs will be the responsibility of the Customer. These costs may include, but are not limited to, onsite repairs, replacements, and troubleshooting efforts that could have been prevented through adherence to the Customer’s obligations under this SLA or any other agreement.\n\n8. Force Majeure\n\nNeither party shall be liable for any failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement where such failure results from any cause beyond the reasonable control of that party, including, but not limited to, mechanical, electronic, or communications failure or degradation, network failures, acts of God, fire, floods, or severe weather conditions. In the event of such a force majeure, the affected party will notify the other party and make all reasonable efforts to minimise the impact of the event. Service obligations will be suspended during and due to the force majeure event and will resume once the event has ended or is resolved.\n\n9. Modifications to the SLA\n\nEvercam may propose modifications to this SLA from time to time. Any proposed changes will be communicated to the Customer at least 7 days prior to the effective date of such changes. Continued use of Evercam's services after the effective date of any changes will constitute the Customer’s acceptance of the modified terms.\n\nSupport Services Communication and feedback\n\nEvercam is committed to delivering exceptional service, and to partnering with our Customers to ensure the successful deployment and use of Evercam’s solutions and services. We continually review our practices to improve internal operations and deliver a service that meets our Customers needs.\n\nSupport tickets can be submitted 24h per day, 7 days per week,  365 days per year. Customers should email\n\nsupport@evercam.io\n\nLink: mailto:support@evercam.io\n\nto create a ticket. For the fastest response, please use this email address in addition to, or in place of, your Evercam Account Manager’s email address.\n\nAll enquiries will be assigned a case number, and will be answered directly by our support team. The remote support team monitors open support cases and allocates appropriate resources to facilitate resolution. This process provides a formal mechanism to handle more complex issues and ensures that Evercam's standards of customer service are maintained. This Case Number should be quoted by the Customer in any follow up communications relating to the initial ticket.\n\nIn our commitment to continuous improvement, Evercam actively seeks to understand Customer perspectives on the services rendered. Upon the closure of each support case, we request feedback regarding the service provided. This feedback is systematically reviewed and utilised to assess and enhance our service delivery standards, ensuring that we consistently elevate the Cuctomer experience with Evercam.\n\nEvercam and its distributors may occasionally send critical service operation notifications to all users, irrespective of email notification preferences.\n\nIf an issue is not resolved within the standard resolution times, the Customer may escalate the case by contacting Evercam’s Customer Success Manager or Account Manager. Evercam will acknowledge the escalation within 1 business day and prioritise resolution efforts.\n\nIn the event of unresolved disputes regarding service obligations or the terms of this SLA, both parties agree to engage in good-faith negotiations to settle the dispute within 30 days. If the dispute remains unresolved after this period, both parties will agree to submit the dispute to mediation by a third-party mediator, to be mutually agreed upon. The mediation will be conducted in accordance with the rules of an acknowledged mediation body chosen by both parties.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/4bf1c2a7-c871-4f3d-bfe8-98b0e8433621/6b306eff-0c66-4296-957d-76415242aa1c/AD_4nXeq5d2IPQreWqaw9yTb4IPRFp6gNNhtnFRriSSxQIq5dLxMxWuFuObh5XGzweI61X1L4Z28VEBQ9Hy3qBdBxoNBrIxceKja3H5a1Fr0lm4lgs9IFVAM0mEWgZedM43rSP0chlTh7w?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084915Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=8c878885704e8943993cccb958b48ee7fd3c872d803da9fe9db3acd878bf213f&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject"

    "title": "Business Continuity Plan",
    "url": "https://user.evercam.io/doc/business-continuity-plan-hzVbF9Goeq",
    "text": "Purpose\n\nTo operate a successful business, and meet the requirements of our stakeholders, our organisation has to identify the services that are most critical, and put in place plans for managing possible disruptions to these services. We also need to manage information security risks that may arise with any disruptions to services and recovery efforts, and ensure our information security controls are not compromised during the disruption. Failure to meet our requirements for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of our services and associated information assets may put the information of our employees, customers, and third-parties, at risk, and breach our SLAs. This document details how our organisation responds to service disruptions.\n\nScope\n\nThis business continuity plan (BCP) shall be applied to our business critical information systems and services that fall within the scope of our ISMS.\n\nAudience\n\nAll employees, contractors, and third-parties who have responsibility for planning and initiating business continuity activities shall adhere to this BCP. These include, but may not be limited to:\n\nManagers\n\nDepartment heads\n\nSystem administrators\n\nNetwork engineers\n\nSystem & asset owners\n\nContractors\n\nSystem architects\n\nIT support\n\nIT service providers\n\nFor the purposes of this document, the employees, contractors, and third-parties who carry out these roles shall be collectively referred to as \"continuity managers\".\n\nCommunication\n\nThis BCP shall be communicated to all employees and agency staff as part of the relevant department training programme, and periodically following any changes to the procedure, or prior to any BCP training exercises. All contractors and third-parties providing BCP and continuity services, or outsourced incident monitoring and response, shall be provided with a copy of this procedure as part of the process for contracting services. Contractors and third-parties shall be re-issued with updated versions of this procedure periodically, and following any changes. Contractors and third-parties shall also be re-issued with the latest version of this procedure when engaging in BCP training exercises. Members of the BCP Team shall retain offline copies of this document for reference in the event that our information systems become unavailable during an incident.\n\nImprovement\n\nThis document is reviewed for improvement in several ways. They are:\n\nManagement review on an annual basis to determine if the procedure continues to meet the requirements of the organisation\n\nIndependent review of our organisation's ISMS which may identify areas of non-conformance or opportunity for improvement\n\nBCP testing and training exercises conducted at planned intervals\n\nManagement also endeavours to plan business continuity activities so that our information and information systems are not misused, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is done by identifying and assigning separate duties and responsibilities to guard against misuses such as fraud, or malicious insider activities, etc. Where a continuity manager identifies potential conflicts or misuse of information systems due to improper planning and assignment of duties when carrying out business continuity activities, continuity managers should raise their concern immediately with their line manager, or the ISMS Manager.\n\n1. Procedure\n\nThe diagram below illustrates the overall procedure for our BCP. Incidents are typically raised and managed in line with our Incident Response Procedure, and where business operations are disrupted, the required business continuity and disaster recovery activities would take place during the mobilisation of the Incident Response Team (IRT) and recovery stage of the Incident Response Procedure (section 1.3 and section 1.5).\n\nThe procedure consists of the following steps:\n\nDetermine what areas and functions are impacted;\n\nDetermine if third-party involvement is required for disaster recovery activities;\n\nDetermine if the incident requires evacuation or other health and safety considerations;\n\nInitiate the relevant disaster recovery plan and restore the systems, locations, and services as required;\n\nDocument any issues encountered as lessons learned.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/14bf75b4-bf4e-4820-8a26-1a7a93574094/cc2e7050-1bd2-414f-8054-2d860fe13303/BCP.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084913Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=8b42c8773b9f3bc6defa83b015ef16fdb512b4583cb4e66134d49675216c3d86&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\n2.

Roles & Responsibilities\n\nThe roles and responsibilities for carrying out our BCP are defined below. Depending on the type of disruption and services impacted, different continuity managers may be required to step into these roles. The below roles and their descriptions should not be considered exhaustive:\n\nRole\n\nDescription & Responsibilities\n\nIncident Response Team (IRT)\n\nWhen a potential incident is identified, the IRT shall initiate our Incident Response Procedure. The IRT shall be responsible for:\n\nDetermining an initial criticality of the incident in line with the Incident Response Procedure\n\nWhere there is unavailability or disruption of services, notifying the BCP Team so that BCP activities can begin\n\nMaintaining oversight of BCP activities to ensure they are carried out by the BCP Team as planned\n\nHandling incident communications in line with the Incident Response Procedure\n\nEnsuring the BCP Team document any issues for inclusion in the Incident Report\n\nBCP Team\n\nWhere an incident has resulted in the unavailability or disruption of services, the BCP Team forms to execute the relevant continuity activities. The BCP Team shall consist of continuity managers that are relevant to the services impacted, and not all members of the BCP Team may be required to participate. For example, where services in a third-party data centre are impacted, it would not be necessary for the HR Lead to carry out any evacuation or health and safety activities. In some situations, members of the BCP Team may also be members of the IRT. In these cases, the Incident Response Lead shall ensure that the team member's duties are appropriately prioritised and supported to reduce potential conflict. The BCP Team is responsible for:\n\nLiaising with the IRT to communicate the status of BCP activities and estimated recovery times\n\nDetermining the priority of BCP activities once the incident is assessed\n\nEnsuring BCP activities are carried out as planned\n\nDocumenting any issues with the execution of the planned activities such as recovery problems, unexpected dependencies, communication issues, etc.\n\nTechnology Lead\n\nThe Technology Lead is familiar with disaster recovery procedures for all technology services provided to customers, third-parties, and internally as documented in section 2 of this document. The Technology Lead should be a person with suitable authority and expertise in the operations team, and should also be able to facilitate emergency access to systems and technology resources, should this become necessary during the incident. The Technology Lead is responsible for:\n\nDetermining which information systems and assets are impacted\n\nInitiating and overseeing the relevant disaster recovery procedures\n\nLiaising with the IRT to communicate the status of disaster recovery activities\n\nEnsuring any issues are documented and provided to the IRT as required\n\nInformation Security Lead\n\nThe Information Security Lead provides guidance and information regarding our business' requirements for information security, and assists with identifying potential risks, during BCP activities.\n\nData Protection Lead\n\nThe Data Protection Lead provides guidance and information where disruption of services may impact our ability to meet regulatory requirements such as making personal data available. For example, in an emergency situation where paper records need to be moved from a site, the Data Protection Lead would provide advice and assistance with moving the personal records to ensure their safety, security, and accessibility. Another example may be where recovery of cloud-based services require infrastructure and data to be moved to a different region. In this situation, the Data Protection Lead would provide guidance on the legal requirements of moving the data to the new region.\n\nHR Lead\n\nThe HR Lead is responsible for carrying out business continuity activities that involve the health and safety of personnel and visitors during emergency events. The HR Lead should be a person with suitable authority in the HR department, and should have expert knowledge of health and safety requirements, and emergency contact procedures.\n\nFacilities Lead\n\nThe Facilities Lead manages the physical security of our physical sites and is responsible for providing access to our recovery sites and/or alternative working areas where our primary offices may become unavailable. The Facilities Lead may also need to advise on physical security and access requirements to ensure physical security requirements are maintained in the alternative sites, where available. The Facilities Lead should be a person with the appropriate levels of authority in their area so that emergency access is facilitated and managed, where required.\n\n4. Plan Execution\n\nIn line with the procedure documented in section 1, the following BCP activities should be carried out prior to initiating any disaster recovery procedures. The activities carried out during an incident will vary depending on the criticality of the incident, and the key areas affected. The activities listed below are not in order of priority; the BCP Team shall determine the priority of the activities as part of the incident assessment.\n\nOnce all relevant personnel, third-parties, and resources have been organised, disaster recovery procedures for the affected services should be initiated as required.\n\nActivity\n\nContinuity Manager/s Responsible\n\nIdentify the key business areas impacted (section 2 above)\n\nIdentify required Disaster Recovery procedures\n\nContact emergency services\n\nContact technology managed services providers (third party providers: GitHub, GitLab, data centres)\n\nContact key personnel involved in health and safety procedures\n\nContact access key holders at affected sites (warehouses in EU, UK, USA and HQ) to facilitate access and/or evacuation\n\nFacilities Lead, Site Ops leaders\n\nContact key personnel involved in disaster recovery procedures\n\nOrganise emergency remote access to sites and services\n\nOrganise emergency equipment for key personnel (laptop, mobile phone, access cards, security tokens, etc.)\n\n5. Continuity Testing\n\nWhere our BCP is untested, our organisation may fail to carry out the plan as expected, resulting in unacceptable disruption to the key systems and services identified in section 2 of this document, possible risk to personnel, and/or loss of information. To ensure our BCP, and relevant disaster recovery procedures, are accurate and work as expected, the following is required:\n\nAdministrators are required to identify and document system recovery and information backup procedures in line with section 3.8 of our Information Systems Security Policy. The Technology Lead assigned to the BCP Team shall work with administrators to ensure disaster recovery procedures for the key systems and services identified in section 2 of this plan are identified and documented.\n\nAdministrators are required to test recovery procedures and backups at regular intervals in line with section 3.8 of our Information Systems Security Policy. The Technology Lead assigned to the BCP Team shall work with administrators to ensure the disaster recovery procedures are appropriately tested at the agreed intervals. This will provide reasonable assurance that key systems and information can be recovered safely, and as expected, during a disruptive event.\n\nThe Technology Lead assigned to the BCP Team shall work with administrators to ensure that all disaster recovery procedures relevant to our key systems and services are kept accurate and up-to-date, taking into account the results of the testing performed.\n\nThe BCP Team shall ensure that appropriate BCP testing and training exercises, as previously mentioned in the Improvement section of this document, are identified and carried out at approved intervals. Testing and training exercises may include, but are not limited to:\n\nDeveloping testing and training exercises based on scenarios that have occurred previously within our organisation;\n\nDeveloping testing and training exercises from other sources relevant to our organisation's industry, technology, or threat intelligence gathered in line with section 1 of our Information Systems Security Policy\n\nThe BCP Team shall ensure that testing and training exercises are appropriately documented so that any identified improvements and/or risks can be reviewed and raised to our Improvement Register and/or Risk Register, as appropriate. Incident Report records may be used for documenting testing and training exercises provided they are clearly marked as test exercises.\n\nCreated by: (ISMS team)\n\nCreation date: 04.08.2023\n\nLast modification date: 20-01-2025\n\nDocument approver: Director of support"

    "text": "Purpose\n\nWhen an incident occurs which affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Evercam's or our Clients' information and associated assets, a fast, practiced response is critical to minimising the potential impact of the incident. A failure to properly plan for, and respond to, incidents may put our services, and the information of our employees, customers, and third-parties, at risk, resulting in reputational damage and potential financial loss. This document details how our organisation responds to incidents.\n\nScope\n\nThis procedure shall be applied to all information security incidents that may impact the information and information systems that fall within the scope of our ISMS.\n\nAudience\n\nAll employees, contractors, and third-parties who have a role in identifying and responding to incidents that impact our information and information systems shall follow this Incident Response Procedure. These people include, but may not be limited to:\n\nSenior management\n\nManagers\n\nDepartment heads\n\nSystem administrators\n\nNetwork engineers\n\nSystem & asset owners\n\nContractors\n\nIT support\n\nIT service providers\n\nData protection professionals\n\nSecurity professionals\n\nFor the purposes of this document, the employees, contractors, and third-parties who have a role in our incident response procedures shall be collectively referred to as \"incident responders\".\n\nCommunication\n\nThis Incident Response Procedure shall be communicated to all employees and agency staff as part of the relevant department training programme, and periodically following any changes to the procedure, or prior to any incident response training exercises. All contractors and third-parties providing IT and operations services, or outsourced incident monitoring and response, shall be provided with a copy of this procedure as part of the process for contracting services. Contractors and third-parties shall be re-issued with updated versions of this procedure periodically, and following any changes. Contractors and third-parties shall also be re-issued with the latest version of this procedure when engaging in incident response training exercises. Members of the Incident Response Team (IRT) shall retain offline copies of this document for reference in the event that our information systems become unavailable during an incident.\n\nDisciplinary Process\n\nWhere an incident responder identifies a potential incident and knowingly ignores an incident, or fails to respond to the incident in breach of this Incident Response Procedure, they shall be subject to the disciplinary process documented in the Company Manual, or the applicable service contract.\n\nImprovement\n\nThis document is reviewed for improvement in several ways. They are:\n\nManagement review on an annual basis to determine if the procedure continues to meet the requirements of the organisation\n\nIndependent review of our organisation's ISMS which may identify areas of non-conformance or opportunity for improvement\n\nThe procedure is to be updated based on the tests results from incident response and BCB exercises\n\nManagement also endeavours to plan incident response procedures so that our information and information systems are not misused or compromised during a security incident, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is done by identifying and assigning separate duties and responsibilities to guard against damaging insider activities. Where an incident responder identifies potential conflicts in the carrying out of incident response activities, incident responders should raise their concern immediately with their line manager, or the ISMS Manager.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe Incident Response Procedure has been developed based on best practice principles for responding to information security incidents. Briefly, the primary stages of incident response are:\n\nPreparation\n\nIdentification\n\nContainment\n\nEradication\n\nRecovery\n\nLessons learned\n\nThe diagram below illustrates our Incident Response Procedure:\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/14bf75b4-bf4e-4820-8a26-1a7a93574094/1698fb98-3f43-4ffd-8dcc-561e18f9382a/download.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084913Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=7e3fc492989577204f241baa1c360c4be7c7e41f208b013c1a69250d65f663d9&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nReporting\n\nIncident responders may become aware of potential incidents from various sources, including customers and third-parties. Our employees, contractors, and third-parties are prepared to report incidents as follows: Users report directly to IT or their line managers in line with our Information Security Policy and Security Awareness Training Course/training programmes; Administrators report directly to the IRT in line with our Information Systems Security Policy.\n\nFirst Response\n\nOnce an incident responder has been made aware of a potential incident, they shall prepare for possible escalation of the incident by:\n\nCarrying out a preliminary assessment of the incident to determine if it is a potential security incident;\n\nNotifying the Incident Response Lead immediately where it is confirmed to be a potential security incident;\n\nAssisting the incident reporter in performing initial containment activities, such as disconnection from the network;\n\nAvoiding making any changes to affected information and information systems, where possible;\n\nEnsuring that any users or other third-parties do not touch or remove affected equipment, where possible.\n\nMobilising the Incident Response Team\n\nOnce the Incident Response Lead has been alerted to a potential information security incident, they shall:\n\nRefer to the Incident Response Contact Sheet and contact IRT members and organise an initial meeting to confirm that the incident is a security incident, and determine an initial criticality level for the incident.\n\nThis can be via conference call or a face-to-face team meeting, as appropriate.\n\nOpen an Incident Report once the security incident is confirmed and record the initial meeting details. Contact senior management or relevant department heads to notify them of the incident.\n\nCall a formal \"War Room\" meeting of the IRT. Depending on the criticality of the incident, not all IRT members may be required for the meeting.\n\nMeeting security considerations\n\nTo minimise the risk of unofficial communication of the incident, the venue should not be in a public area. The venue should also not be located in an area with limited access to communications. Alternatively, the meeting may be held via conference call or other web-based conferencing services. Where there is a need to use conferencing services outside of the provided business services, the Incident Response Lead shall ensure that meeting invites to the conference or video call require authentication to join, and that the service is secure in line with our Information Systems Security Policy.\n\nDetermining incident criticality\n\nDetermining a criticality level for the security incident assists the IRT in deciding who to notify, and what resources are necessary to resolve the incident. For example, where the criticality is low, notifying all members of the management team may not be required. In situations where more than one incident may be occurring, prioritising the incidents will allow them to be handled in the correct order. Our organisation uses the below criteria to help determine the criticality of the security incident. They should be used as guidance only, and should not be considered exhaustive:\n\nCriticality\n\nDescription\n\nLow\n\nLess than 5 user laptops or computers infected with malware\n\nData breach of some information classified as \"Internal\"\n\nData breach of 1 person's personal data\n\nUnauthorised access of a user to a non-critical information system\n\nSuccessful phishing attack on 1 user\n\nUnavailability of a non-critical information system which doesn't impact customers\n\nMedium\n\n1 or more departments with laptops or computers infected with malware\n\nData breach of some information classified as \"Confidential\"\n\nData breach of personal data impacting up to 10 people\n\nUnauthorised access of a user to a critical information system\n\nSuccessful phishing attack on up to 5 users\n\nUnavailability of several non-critical information systems causing disruption to business operations\n\nHigh\n\nMost departments and endpoints impacted by malware\n\nData breach impacting Customer Data\n\nData breach of \"Highly Confidential\" data\n\nData breach impacting the personal data of more than 10 people\n\nUnauthorised access of a malicious attacker to critical information systems\n\nSuccessful phishing attack which has resulted in financial loss\n\nUnavailability of critical information systems impacting customers\n\nAssessment\n\nOnce the IRT is formally assembled, they shall perform the following activities:\n\nDetermine if the incident is ongoing, and what steps can be taken towards containing it;\n\nDetermine the possible cause of the incident.\n\nWhere the cause is known this may also assist with containment.\n\nDetermine the impact of the incident by identifying:\n\nAny information that may be compromised or at risk, and any controls in place to protect the data such as encryption, backups, etc. Affected infrastructure e.g. servers, communications equipment, cloud-based infrastructure, computers, office locations, etc.\n\nAffected services e.g. intranet, CRM, etc. Affected customers.\n\nAffected departments.\n\nHow long services have been unavailable for, where relevant.\n\nBased on the impact assessment, determine any additional resources required to resolve the incident.\n\nDetermine if digital forensics will be required, and what evidence may need to be collected.\n\nDetermine if third-party support is required for containment, eradication, recovery, and/or forensics activities and initiate contact.\n\nDetermine the relevant authorities and third-parties that may need to be notified, such as law enforcement, data protection supervisory authorities, customers, service providers, etc. and initiate contact.\n\nRecord all meeting minutes and assessment information directly to the Incident Report, where available.\n\nContainment, Eradication, & Recovery\n\nOnce the security incident has been assessed, and all necessary resources mobilised to resolve the incident, the IRT shall:\n\nOversee all steps taken to contain, eradicate, and recover from the threat, ensuring that relevant decisions and actions taken are recorded for inclusion in the Incident Report\n\nEnsure that potential evidence is identified, and that all incident responders are informed of the correct handling procedures\n\nEnsure that any changes raised to resolve the incident, such as emergency vulnerability patching, are made in line with our Change Control Procedure\n\nEnsure that any business continuity activities performed to recover services are done in line with our Business Continuity Plan\n\nHandling potential evidence\n\nWhere forensic investigation of the incident is required, our organisation shall appoint a qualified third-party to carry out the investigation. However, incident responders may still need to handle and secure potential evidence. Incident responders shall: Avoid making any changes to data, or accessing the original system, where possible. Avoid powering off affected endpoints, where possible. This will allow volatile data to be preserved. Keep a record of what they did and when they didn’t i.e. from arriving on scene, to handling equipment, to performing any containment tasks, to securing equipment, etc. Ensure that any users or other third-parties do not touch or remove affected equipment. Take photos or video of the equipment or area where this may be helpful to do so. Ensure that any photos, video, equipment or other evidence is stored securely and only accessible to authorised persons. Where evidence may need to be accessed, moved, or transferred, ensure that chain of custody is recorded. Where evidence is collected by the third-party forensic investigator, ensure that any Chain of Custody Form(s) are completed, signed, and stored securely\n\nCommunication is a key element of effective incident response. Without it, incident responders may not know how or when to act, key decision-makers may not have all the necessary information required to make effective decisions, third-parties and customers may not know when to expect services to be re-established, communications officers may not know what to communicate to the public, and authorities may not be properly notified in line with legal requirements.\n\nThe IRT shall be responsible for maintaining effective communications throughout the incident by:\n\nEnsuring approved means of internal communication are established so that all required incident responders are contactable, taking into consideration the availability of company systems, equipment, and mobile phones.\n\nEnsuring that relevant department heads or line managers are delegated to pass on all necessary communications to employees, contractors, and third-parties they are responsible for.\n\nEnsuring that communications are accurately tracked and documented for reporting purposes. Where legal action may result from the incident, it may be advisable to take audio recordings of important communications. These audio recordings shall be handled as evidence in line with section 1.5.1 of this document.\n\nEnsuring that details of the security incident are not communicated to unauthorised persons.\n\nEnsuring external stakeholders such as customers, regulatory authorities, law enforcement, suppliers, etc. are notified of the incident, as required.\n\nEnsuring that all calls regarding the incident are properly directed e.g. where the media may make contact, this should be directed to the line manager or department head responsible for public communications. Liaising with the public communications team to ensure all public communications are approved prior to release.\n\nIncident Conclusion\n\nWhile some aspects of recovery may still be ongoing, it may no longer be necessary to have the IRT mobilised. At this point, the Incident Response Lead shall: Determine if the security incident has been resolved to an acceptable degree. Review the Incident Report and other relevant documentation to ensure all necessary information is recorded, accurate, and appropriately secured. Schedule follow-up meetings where required, such as in situations where recovery is ongoing. Inform management and other relevant department heads that the IRT is no longer required for the incident and will be ceasing immediate incident response activities. Schedule a lessons-learned session for post-incident analysis.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nWhile the handling and resolution of a security incident can be a stressful event, it is crucial that the IRT and other relevant incident responders take time to carry out post-incident analysis. Analysing the incident will allow the IRT to identify possible improvements, both in the handling of the incident, and in current security controls. The IRT shall:\n\nCarry out a post-incident analysis at a scheduled date; Identify possible improvements; Identify possible outstanding risks, such as areas that may be impacted by a similar incident occurring;\n\nCarry out a risk assessment in line with our Risk Management Process;\n\nEnsure all improvements are recorded to the Improvement Register, where required;\n\nEnsure all risks are recorded to the Risk Register, where required;\n\nEnsure the lessons learned are recorded to the Incident Report; Close the incident, and record this in the Incident Report.\n\nRoles & Responsibilities\n\nThe roles and responsibilities required for carrying out our Incident Response Procedure are defined below. There may be situations where roles may be combined, or they may be carried out by the same person. The below roles and their descriptions should not be considered exhaustive:\n\nRole\n\nDescriptions and Responsibilities\n\nIncident Response Lead\n\nThe Incident Response Lead is the first point-of-contact for the IRT.

Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of the information we use ensures that the operations we perform, and the services we provide, continue to meet our business objectives, comply with regulatory and legal requirements, and fulfil the requirements of our stakeholders. It also ensures that any personal data we process about our employees and customers is kept secure, minimising any potential risks or harm that may be caused by a breach of that data.\n\nManagement is committed to the security of our information, and have developed and approved this information security policy in line with the requirements of the ISO 27001 standard for information security, and our organisation's business requirements.\n\nThis document sets out the approved information security policy so that it can be clearly communicated to all employees, contractors, and other relevant third-parties.\n\nScope\n\nThis policy shall apply to all the business processes and information processing activities that fall within the scope of our organisation's Information Security Management System (ISMS). For simplicity, we consider all work-related activities of employees, contractors, or other relevant third-parties to be within the scope of this policy document unless explicitly excluded.\n\nAudience\n\nAll employees, contractors, and other relevant third-parties shall adhere to this Information Security Policy while performing work-related activities as part of their day-to-day duties. For the purposes of this document, policy instructions directed at employees shall also apply to contractors, and other relevant third-parties, and shall be collectively referred to as \"users\". Where discussing the classification and handling of information, users with overall responsibility for the data shall be referred to as the \"data owner\".\n\nCommunication\n\nThis Information Security Policy shall be communicated to all employees and agency staff as part of our employee induction programme, and periodically following any changes to the policy. All contractors and other relevant third- parties shall be provided with a copy of this policy document as part of the process for contracting services, and shall be re-issued with updated versions periodically following any changes to the policy.\n\nDisciplinary Process\n\nWhere an employee, contractor, or other relevant third-party performs an activity or activities in breach of this Information Security Policy, they shall be subject to the disciplinary process documented in the Company Manual or the applicable service contract.\n\nImprovement\n\nManagement is committed to the continual improvement of our Information Security Policy, and shall review this document on an annual basis, or whenever an independent review of our organisation's ISMS reveals a non-conformance or opportunity for improvement. The Management Review shall determine if this policy continues to meet the requirements of our organisation.\n\nManagement also endeavours to plan our business operations so that our information and information assets are not misused, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is done by identifying and assigning separate duties throughout our critical business activities to guard against misuses such as fraud, or errors in data processing activities, etc.\n\nWhere a user identifies potential conflicts or misuse of information or information assets due to improper planning and assignment of duties, users should raise their concern immediately with their line manager, or the ISMS Manager.\n\nClassification & Handling of Information\n\nTo ensure that the information we process is handled appropriately and securely, it is important that all users know how to identify the sensitivity of the data, and follow our requirements for how to handle that data. This section sets out how our organisation classifies our information, and how users should handle that information.\n\nData Classifications\n\nAll data shared with customers should be converted to PDF before sending unless it's a collaborative document, in this case it should contain a label \"draft\" or \"work in progress\". In addition to the table below, users shall review and adhere to the data handling principles set out in the supporting document, Data Handling & Retention Guidelines. This will ensure that even unclassified data is properly handled and protected.\n\nConfidentiality Level\n\nDescription\n\nTypical Examples\n\nLabelling\n\nLegal/Regulatory Considerations\n\nHandling\n\nAvailability/Disposal\n\nPublic\n\nInformation that is or can be made publicly available.\n\npublishing and marketing materials, website content, published financial statements, social media communication and content, advertised job titles and roles, product catalogues and brochures\n\nNo labelling required.

This section provides detail on our approved policy for transferring data.\n\n1.1.1   Digital data\n\nWhere there is a requirement to transfer internal, confidential, or highly confidential digital data outside of our organisation, the following shall apply:\n\nUsers shall ensure that they use only the approved method for transferring the data. These methods are approved by data owners and system administrators. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\nForced TLS\n\nSecure web transfer e.g. secure web-portals, API, etc. SFTP\n\nGPG\n\nApproved document sharing methods such as Google Drive\n\nEncrypting individual files and sending as email attachments\n\nWhere users encrypt individual files as email attachments, the encryption key must be sent to the recipient using a second channel, such as SMS, or phone call. Users must never send both the data and the encryption key via email.\n\n1.1.2   Physical data\n\nWhere there is a requirement to transfer internal, confidential, or highly confidential data in physical format such as paper records, backup media, tape, CD/DVD, USB, etc. the following shall apply:\n\nUsers shall use only approved couriers for physical media collection and transfer. Couriers that are approved for use ensure the required levels of security in handling and delivering the physical media.\n\nUsers shall ensure that physical media storing digital data, such as USB, hard disk, etc. is encrypted wherever possible.\n\nUsers shall ensure that physical media is packaged in a way that does not allow the physical media to be accessed and/or damaged during transit. For example, with backup tape media, this may include secure containers provided by the backup tape collection and storage provider, etc.\n\nUsers shall request confirmation from the courier that the package has been delivered as expected, and that it has been signed for by the intended recipient, or persons nominated by the recipient.\n\nUsers shall confirm with the recipient that the package is received in an undamaged/unacessed state.\n\nWhen receiving physical media, users shall ensure that they are available to sign for the package wherever possible. Where this is not possible, users must nominate another user to sign, and must ensure that the user knows how to secure the package. Packages containing physical data must not be left unattended in reception, or other common areas.\n\n1.2  Protecting Data From Loss\n\nEven where users adhere to the handling requirements set out in the table above, the daily use, coping, and sharing of information may result in unintended loss, or data leakage. To minimise the likelihood of data leakage, the following policies shall apply:\n\nUsers shall not take photos or screenshots of sensitive or confidential information. Where the photo or screenshot is saved to the device, it may be stored in an un-secure location, and accessible to unauthorised users.\n\nUsers shall regularly review and purge temporary file locations, such as the \"Downloads\" folder, draft document locations, operating system recycle bins, and other trash functions. Files created and downloaded for temporary use may contain sensitive or confidential data, and remain stored in unsecured locations indefinitely, increasing the risk of unauthorised access and data breach.\n\nUsers shall not use auto-completion of email addresses when sending emails. Where auto-completion of email addresses is used, this can result in the wrong email address being selected, and sensitive or confidential information being sent to unintended recipients. Users should either copy and paste, or fully type out, the correct email address when it is necessary to send sensitive or confidential information via email. Sensitive or confidential information shall always be secured in line with section 1.1.1 of this policy when emailed.\n\n2.    Securing Working Environments\n\nWhether in the office or at home, physical security measures are essential for ensuring that our users, information, and information assets are protected at all times. This section sets out our requirements for physical security.\n\n2.1  Security in the Office\n\nWhen working from our designated offices or warehouses, the following policies shall apply:\n\nUsers that are issued with keys or access fobs will not lend or transfer them to any other member of staff without prior authorisation.\n\nUsers must report the loss of any keys or access fobs immediately.\n\nUsers must ensure any company offices or warehouses are secured before departure and Users must inform management if, for any reason, they are unable to secure the premises.\n\nUsers shall ensure that all site visitors are accompanied by a staff member.\n\nUsers shall not allow tailgating into the office i.e. users shall not allow anyone who does not have their own key or access fob to follow them into controlled office areas. The person may not be approved to enter our office area/s, and may pose a risk to other users and/or our assets.\n\nWhen a user notices an unauthorised person, or unaccompanied guest, in our office area/s, they should approach them only if they consider it safe to do so. In this case, the user shall escort the person back to reception. In a situation where it may be unsafe to challenge the person, users shall alert security staff and/or colleagues, and ensure the person remains in sight until assistance arrives.\n\nWhere PIN codes are used for access, users shall not write down their PINs, or communicate their PINs to other users. Where PIN codes are needed, these shall be provided to users during their induction period and shall not be shared.\n\nUsers working in secure areas shall not leave the secure area unlocked when they are not present.\n\nWhere maintenance is required in secure areas, users working in secure areas shall ensure that the work taking place is monitored at all times.\n\nWhen receiving deliveries at a loading area or service access area, the user receiving the delivery shall ensure that delivery or service personnel are monitored at all times until the delivery is complete. The user shall ensure that the delivery is then appropriately secured.\n\n2.2  Security at Home\n\nWhen working from home, users should follow this set of recommendations:\n\nUsers should not leave guests, builders, or service engineers unattended in the designated home office area. Where this is unavoidable, users should observe strict clean desk and clear screen policies as set out in section below, and should not leave mobile phones or other easily removable devices in plain view.\n\nUsers should instruct family members or housemates who may share the space to not leave guests, builders, or service engineers unattended in the designated home office area.\n\nUsers should ensure work-related deliveries are not left in shared areas where they may be inadvertently opened.\n\n2.3  Security in Public or Shared Spaces\n\nWhen working in public areas, or other shared spaces such as co-working environments, it can be more difficult to implement physical security measures than in a home environment. The following policies apply for working in public and shared spaces:\n\nUsers shall ensure that they are familiar with, and abide by, the physical security policies of any co-working spaces that they may use while carrying out work on behalf of our organisation. This may include being issued with a unique ID badge for authorised access to work spaces and facilities, reception sign-in, secure check-in, adherence to safety instructions and drills, etc.\n\nWhere there is a lack of physical security controls in a co-working space, or the controls contradict the requirements set out for office security in section above, users shall adhere to the requirements of this section wherever possible. This will ensure a minimum level of physical security is applied, no matter where the user may be required to work from.\n\nUsers shall immediately raise any concerns regarding the security of their physical working environment with their line manager. Concerns may include, but not be limited to:\n\nNo facility to securely receive work-related deliveries\n\nOther users of the space sharing authentication mechanisms such as PIN codes, ID badges, fobs, etc.\n\nNo facilities for secure document disposal such as lockable waste bins or document shredders No facility to print documents securely such as personal printers or authenticated print release No facilities to secure equipment or belongings such as lockers or lockable drawers\n\nNo perimeter security for the building or work space\n\nLack of appropriate health and safety mechanisms that may make the space unsafe to work in\n\nWhen working in more public environments such as a hotel, conference centre, public transport, etc., it may not be possible to apply necessary physical security measures. In this case, users shall adhere to section 3 of this policy, and shall ensure they appropriately protect all information assets they may be using while travelling or working outside of the office or home.\n\nWhere there is a lack of suitable privacy in any public environment a user may be working in, users shall not conduct confidential calls or meetings related to their work. Users shall wait until a suitable level of privacy is available, or alternatively issue required communications via a secure channel, such as company email.\n\n3.    Using Information Assets\n\nOur organisation provides approved applications and services to users so that they can carry out their work-related duties. The applications and services are our information assets, and this section sets out the policies for using those assets appropriately.\n\n3.1  Monitoring\n\nTo ensure that our information and information assets are accessed and used in a secure way that minimises any information security risks, and that we meet our legal and regulatory requirements, our organisation retains the right to carry out monitoring of employee devices and company services. These monitoring activities are not productivity monitoring activities, and any examination of user account activity shall be done only with appropriate management and/or HR approval.\n\nIn order to carry out monitoring activities, we may:\n\nConfigure alerting or activity reporting on services provided to users\n\nStore and review logs or other data generated from monitoring activities\n\nRequest ad hock endpoint security checks on employee devices\n\nUsers shall comply with our monitoring activities as follows:\n\nUsers should strictly comply with the company BYOD policy and not attempt to remove or tamper with the prescribed configurations (as per the Endpoint Security Review checklist)\n\nUsers shall not attempt to disable or bypass settings that facilitate monitoring, such as proxy server or web- filtering settings.\n\nUsers shall use only the user account assigned to them when using our services unless authorised to use service.\n\nAdministrators of services shall not attempt to alter or temper any logging data that may be stored.\n\n3.2  Securing Equipment & Records\n\nWhile using equipment and services, the following policies shall apply:\n\nUsers shall not leave equipment such as laptops and mobile phones unattended in communal office areas such as meeting rooms, toilets, kitchens, reception, etc.\n\nWhen leaving laptops unattended in unsecured areas is unavoidable, users shall use the security cables provided to secure laptops to desks, meeting room tables, etc.\n\nUsers shall adhere to the clear desk and clear screen principle, by ensuring the following whenever they step away from the desk:\n\nThat all work-related documents and mobile devices are placed in drawers or secured in lockable cabinets\n\nThat their computer or laptop is locked and cannot be viewed or accessed by any other person\n\nUsers shall ensure any paper records are secured in designated filing areas or secure filing cabinets. When working from home, users should keep printing to a minimum, and should not leave work-related documents in general areas.\n\nUsers shall ensure that any printed records not required for filing shall be disposed of in the secure recycling bins provided. When working from home, users requiring document disposal shall contact their line manager to discuss providing either collection services, or separate shredding facilities.\n\n3.3  Using Equipment\n\nOur organisation mandates the use of personal devices for company use. This is typically known as a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy. The use of personal devices is risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process, and may not be permitted in some situations, such as with users responsible for processing highly confidential information. The use of personal devices is subject to annual endpoint security reviews.\n\nThe following section sets our general security requirements for using both company(if applicable) and personal equipment.\n\n3.3.1   Company equipment\n\nWhen using company computers, laptops, or mobile phones, the following policies apply:\n\nUsers shall not log into, or attempt to log into, company equipment that is not assigned to them.\n\nUsers shall not install unapproved applications or software.\n\nUsers shall not connect unapproved removable media such as USBs, external hard-drives, and mobile phones.\n\nUsers shall not insert, or run applications from, removable media such as CDs and DVDs.\n\nUsers shall not transfer data from their company equipment to any removable media unless approved by their line manager and IT.\n\nUsers shall not tamper with, or disable, any anti-virus and/or anti-malware applications installed.

These may be attempts to steal data.\n\nWhere in any doubt, users should use the tethering facility on their mobile phone for internet access.\n\n3.6  Using Email\n\nAcceptable use of our email service is set out in our\n\nPolicies governing the secure use of personal email while working from home on personal devices is outside the scope of this document. The following is a set of recommendations for users working from home and using their own equipment:\n\nUsers should be careful not to use their work email when placing personal online orders. This will assist in identifying malicious email campaigns that try to exploit expected package delivery to steal login credentials.\n\nWhere not enforced, users should always use 2FA for accessing company email services from personal devices.\n\nUsers should be careful to always check which email they are using before sending any work-related email as they may inadvertently be in their personal email.\n\nUsers should avoid using auto-complete when selecting recipient email addresses, and check the recipient address is correct before sending any work-related email.\n\nUsers shall be careful of any email asking for confirmation of login credentials; as a rule users should not click on email links unless they have just requested a password reset and the email has been received as part of the reset process.\n\n3.7  Using Company Social Media\n\nAcceptable use of social media services is set out in our\n\nSocial Media Policy\n\nLink: /s/2c280020-8de7-44b6-bf48-aa15a75b3b42/doc/social-media-hyNCmBYy0y\n\n. Policies governing the secure use of personal social media while working from home on personal devices is outside the scope of this document. Users working from home and using their own equipment should keep the following in mind when using social media services:\n\nUsers should be careful to always check which social media profile they are using before posting any work-related communications or content as they may inadvertently be in their own personal social media profile.\n\nWherever possible, users should always use 2FA for accessing company social media services from personal devices.\n\n4.    Controlling Access to Information Assets\n\nOur organisation uses various authentication information such as passwords, security tokens, 2FA, and PIN codes to authenticate our users, and to secure our services and equipment from unauthorised use. The following policies apply for securing authentication information:\n\nUsers shall not write down, or share their login credentials or PIN codes with anyone; IT and colleagues should never ask for login credentials, and a request for your details might be an attempt to steal them, or bypass anti-fraud measures, etc.\n\nUsers shall create strong, complex passwords. Strong, complex passwords will typically have:\n\nA minimum of 8 characters\n\nA mix of numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and special symbols such as (*%!&)\n\nUsers shall create passwords that are not easily guessed. Passwords that include the names of friends, family, children, pets, birth dates, etc. are easily guessed and may be brute-forced by a malicious attacker. Examples of passwords that are easily guessed will typically have a combination of:\n\nMonth Day Year e.g. January0120!, February2012*, etc.\n\nName Birthday e.g. JohnSmith2390!\n\nUsers shall always use a unique password for each service and account used, regardless of whether it is a personal or company account. If a personal social media account or other personal web-based service account is compromised, malicious persons might gain unauthorised access to company services, or vice versa.\n\nWhere personal devices are used to access company services, users shall not share their login credentials or PIN codes with family members, or allow family members to use the devices.\n\nUsers shall use 2FA for accessing company services, wherever possible. Users shall not tamper with or remove security tokens.\n\n5.    Identifying & Reporting Incidents\n\nWhile performing work-related activities, a situation may arise where a user suspects that a security incident has taken place. Users may notice some of the following:\n\nSuspicious emails such as replies to emails they didn't send, phishing emails, large numbers of spam emails, multiple password reset request emails, etc.\n\nPop-ups, notifications, or web-pages that they do not recognise Sudden slowness of their device and inability to use company services Malware notifications\n\nDisconnection from the office network Inability to log into company services\n\nPersons in office areas that they should not be in Persons without staff badges who are unaccompanied Passwords or PINs written down\n\nUsers verbally sharing their user credentials, or logging onto each other's devices Confidential documents left at printers\n\nSecurity doors propped open and unattended Theft of a mobile phone or laptop\n\nEmail containing confidential data accidentally sent to the wrong person\n\nReports from customers or other third-parties of unavailability of services, or suspicious activity such as spam\n\nWhere users suspect that an incident has taken place, the following policy applies:\n\nUsers shall immediately contact IT and their line manager regarding the suspected incident Users shall provide the following information when reporting the incident:\n\nName\n\nDepartment\n\nContact details\n\nThe time that they first noticed the issue\n\nA description of the issue, to the best of their ability\n\nWhere appropriate, users can take photos of the affected device's screen, or in situations where they have seen doors propped open, where there is evidence of potential theft or break-in, etc. Caution should be used in taking any photos which may display personal data, such as other users in the image, visible personal information on printed documents, etc.\n\nUsers shall treat the incident as confidential, and shall not discuss the incident with other users unless it is necessary for assisting the incident investigation.\n\nUsers shall not communicate any detail of the incident on any social media service, or to any external persons or third-parties. Communication of the incident externally is considered a data breach, and will be investigated. Communication of the incident will be handled and approved as required by management.\n\nCreated by: Compliance Manager (ISMS team)\n\nCreation date: 23.05.2023\n\nLast modification date:\n\n\n\n09.01.2025\n\nDocument approver: Head of Compliance"

These include, but are not limited to, the following roles:\n\nSystem Administrators\n\nNetwork Engineers\n\nIT Support\n\nIT Services Providers\n\nCloud Services Providers\n\nCloud Security Architects\n\nSystem Architects\n\nSystem Developers\n\nInformation Security Analysts\n\nSystem Owners\n\nSystem Testers\n\nFor the purposes of this document, employees, contractors, and third-parties who carry out these roles shall be collectively referred to as \"administrators\".\n\nCommunication\n\nThis Information Systems Security Policy shall be communicated to all employees and agency staff as part of the relevant department training programme, and periodically following any changes to the policy. All contractors and third-parties providing IT services or involved in projects which require connection to our IT systems shall be provided with a copy of this policy as part of the process for contracting services. Contractors and third-parties shall be re-issued with updated versions of this policy periodically, and following any changes.\n\nDisciplinary Process\n\nWhere an administrator performs an activity or activities in breach of this Information Systems Security Policy, they shall be subject to the disciplinary process documented in the Company Manual, or the applicable service contract.\n\nImprovement\n\nManagement is committed to the continual improvement of our Information Systems Security Policy, and shall review this document on an annual basis, or whenever an independent review of our organisation's ISMS reveals a non-conformance or opportunity for improvement. The Management Review shall determine if this policy continues to meet the requirements of our organisation.\n\nManagement also endeavours to plan our business operations so that our IT systems are not misused, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is done by identifying and assigning separate duties and responsibilities to guard against misuses such as fraud, or malicious insider activities, etc. Where an administrator identifies potential conflicts or misuse of information systems due to improper planning and assignment of duties, administrators should raise their concern immediately with their line manager, or the ISMS Manager.\n\nMaintaining Security Awareness\n\nNew threats and vulnerabilities to technologies and services emerge on a daily basis. To ensure that the potential impact of these information security risks is minimised, administrators must remain informed of any threats and vulnerabilities that may affect the services we provide, and the information systems that we use. This will allow security best practice, vulnerability, and threat management to be key elements of how we manage risk. To maintain awareness of emerging threats and vulnerabilities, the following policies apply:\n\nAdministrators shall subscribe to relevant threat intelligence and vulnerability information sources such as security alert feeds, blogs, or forums such as (for example):\n\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cve/data_feeds.html\n\nhttps://isc.sans.edu/\n\n\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/bulletins\n\nhttps://www.cisecurity.org/cybersecurity-threats\n\nAdministrators shall regularly review security alert notifications and other threat intelligence sources to determine if any identified vulnerabilities or issues impact our information systems, services, or how we operate them. Administrators shall ensure that they attend security training provided to them to keep their skill-set up-to-date.\n\nAdministrators should retain evidence of any training received, such as certificates of attendance, certificates of completion, etc., where these are not already retained by HR as part of their employee training programme. Administrators shall maintain regular contact with service and technology providers to ensure that they are kept up-to-date with any vulnerabilities or issues that may arise.\n\nAnalysing Threats\n\nMaintaining awareness of threats and security issues that may impact our organisation and information assets is only useful if the information is appropriately analysed and actioned as part of a threat intelligence process or lifecycle. Threat intelligence, whether gathered from suitable, trusted sources such as those listed in section above, or developed by our own organisation using tools such as security information and event management (SIEM) systems, is crucial to our ability to identify and respond to new and developing security threats. Threat intelligence can be divided into three main types, with each providing a different layer of information:\n\nStrategic intelligence\n\n- high-level, non-technical information about trends in malicious attacks, and the methods and tools attackers are using to launch them. For example, types of malicious attacks and attackers may vary between regions and industries. Where an organisation is expanding into a new region, gathering and assessing strategic threat intelligence would include identifying trends in malicious attacks and attackers in that region. This would allow management to proactively identify necessary resources such as additional security personnel or threat defence systems, before expanding into the new region.\n\nTactical intelligence\n\n- detailed practical information about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malicious attackers to exploit weaknesses in an organisation's infrastructure, and attack information systems and assets. For example, information about malicious traffic seen by security experts could help a networking team to configure their organisation's network to block the traffic using methods such as IP blacklisting. The team could also use the information about malicious traffic to check log data for indicators of compromise (IOCs). These activities could even be automated using technology such as next generation firewalls with an intrusion prevention system (IPS).\n\nOperational intelligence\n\n- more detailed intelligence about how attacks are initiated, why, and by whom. This helps organisation's to understand which information systems and assets are more likely to be attacked, and how. For example, information issued by security experts about a type of phishing campaign targeting users working in public infrastructure could help a system administrator working in a state body to pre-emptively issue warnings to users about the campaign, and identify which systems are likely to be exploited if there is a successful phishing attempt. This would then allow a response plan to be developed and implemented to inform personnel, and patch or reconfigure vulnerable systems.\n\nWhen analysing and actioning threat intelligence, the following policies shall apply:\n\nThe extent and type of intelligence analysed shall depend on the level of risk associated with the loss or compromise of the information systems and assets, and the requirements of the organisation. Administrators shall ensure that information systems and assets are risked assessed in line with our Risk Management Process\n\nto identify relevant threats and vulnerabilities, which will assist in identifying sources of threat intelligence such as those suggested in section 1 above.\n\nWhere necessary, administrators shall identify and implement appropriate tools to log and process threat information. Tools could include, but may not be limited to:\n\nNetworking tools such as IPS, IDS, web content filtering, etc.\n\nLog management tools\n\nVulnerability scanners\n\nApplication firewalls\n\nMalware detection systems\n\nEndpoint detection and response solutions\n\nSpecialist threat analysis platforms and SIEM systems\n\nThird-party services such as a security operations centre (SOC) or network operations centre (NOC)\n\nAdministrators shall identify and document all relevant sources of threat intelligence using our Threat Intelligence Source Review record, including how the information is typically actioned. The information documented shall include, but may not be limited to:\n\nThe exact source of the information\n\nWhether the source is internal or external\n\nWhy the information is necessary\n\nHow the information will be used by the relevant administrator, team, or department\n\nThe Critical Assets the information will be used to protect\n\nThe relevant administrator, team, or department who will use the information\n\nAny applicable documentation on the use of the information, or procedures used to action the information\n\nAdministrators shall review the information sources used at planned intervals to ensure they remain accurate and relevant, and that appropriate procedures are in place for the use of the data, such as communicating required actions to users, updating network configuration guides, reporting industry-related threats to management, etc.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that any logging or monitoring systems used to collect data for analysis adhere to the policies set out in section 7 of this document. Where an identified threat or vulnerability requires that changes be made to information systems and assets, administrators shall ensure that changes are appropriately controlled in line with section 2 of this document.\n\nAdministrators shall use threat information gathered to ensure this policy document is kept up-to-date and relevant. For example, this could include adding additional secure disposal methods to section 3.7, or refining hardening controls set out in section 3.6.\n\nControlling Changes\n\nOur organisation's information systems and services may be impacted by new vulnerabilities, changes in security best practice standards, emerging technologies, impacts to supply chains, introduction of new systems and services, etc. Where required, administrators may need to make or suggest changes to our operating procedures, training requirements, system configurations, etc., and may need to initiate new projects in order to meet our business objectives. When administering our information systems, the following policies shall apply:\n\nAdministrators shall carry out all major changes in line with our Change Control Procedure, including any emergency changes that are raised in order to address discovered or reported security vulnerabilities or weaknesses.\n\nAdministrators shall inform their line manager or the ISMS Manager of any potential security policy changes so that these can be reviewed.\n\nAdministrators shall inform their line manager or the ISMS Manager of all new projects that have been raised or initiated so that these can be assessed for any impacts to information security. This will ensure information security requirements are considered when new projects are initiated.\n\nProtecting Information Systems & Assets\n\nWhile users are required to use our organisation's equipment and services in a secure way, administrators are required to design, develop, administer, and monitor our IT systems and equipment securely, ensuring that any risks to the security of our information are minimised in line with our business objectives. The following section sets out our requirements for IT systems and equipment security.\n\nMaintaining an Asset Inventory\n\nTo ensure all IT systems and equipment are appropriately identified and secured, administrators shall maintain an Equipment Register. The inventory shall include, but may not be limited to:\n\nAsset type i.e. server, firewall, router, switch, laptop, mobile phone, computer, backup tape, etc.\n\nAsset owner (the person assigned responsibility for the asset, or the primary user of the asset)\n\nLocation, where relevant\n\nMake and model, where relevant\n\nSerial number, or other unique identifier (sometimes vendor dependent), where relevant\n\nDate of purchase, if known\n\nDate of destruction, where relevant (see section 3.7)\n\nFor backup tapes, these should be clearly labelled as required by our disaster recovery procedure\n\nThe Equipment Register shall be reviewed at regular intervals, or when major changes occur, to ensure that it is kept up-to-date and accurate.\n\nInventorying cloud-based assets\n\nWhere assets are predominantly cloud-based, it may not be possible or practical to maintain a full and up-to-date asset list as resources may be spun up or shut down on demand. In this case, the following policies apply:\n\nAdministrators shall implement the appropriate controls to restrict the creation, modification, and deletion of any virtual assets such as virtual servers, cloud containers, storage buckets, virtual networking, virtual services, etc.\n\nWhere possible, alerting should be implemented to indicate when critical resources are created, modified, or deleted, and these notifications shall:\n\nBe monitored appropriately to ensure critical assets are not negatively impacted by unplanned modifications\n\nBe logged and retained in line with data retention requirements for periodic review\n\nAdministrators shall periodically review cloud-based assets to ensure that all assets used for testing purposes are shut down, decommissioned, or removed, as required.\n\nAdministrators shall periodically review cloud-based assets to ensure that all assets that have been replaced as part of the maintenance and/or upgrade cycles are shut down, decommissioned, or removed, as required.\n\nSecuring & Maintaining Equipment\n\nPhysical assets may be physically damaged, tampered with, or removed, resulting in a risk to the security of our IT systems and information. Our physical assets must be appropriately protected from damage in line with our business requirements. The following policies shall apply:\n\nAdministrators shall ensure physical access to critical assets is restricted to only authorised persons. Critical assets would include, but may not be limited to, servers, firewalls, backup tapes, switches, UPS devices, redundant power supplies, modems, etc.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that access is removed as soon as it is no longer required.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that third-parties requiring access to restricted areas are accompanied at all times.\n\nSwitch panels which may be attached to walls shall be in lockable cabinets, and the cabinets shall be locked at all times unless maintenance or re-cabling is required. Administrators shall not leave cabinet keys in or near the cabinets.\n\nEthernet, fibre, critical power, and any other necessary cabling shall not be laid in ways that they can be tampered with or damaged, such as over carpets, exposed on walls, etc. Protective cages and/or covers should be used to ensure no cables are exposed.\n\nAppropriate environmental controls shall be installed in server and communication rooms to ensure that equipment is not damaged from excessive temperatures and humidity. UPS devices shall be used wherever necessary to ensure power outages do not damage critical assets.\n\nWhere equipment is installed in server or equipment cages, administrators shall ensure that these are locked at all times unless maintenance, upgrade, or re-cabling is required. Administrators shall not leave cage keys near the cages.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure any keys or access fobs are kept secure, and that only authorised persons have access to these. Removal of assets for maintenance and/or replacement must be authorised, and must be carried out in line with our policy for transferring physical data in our Information Security Policy.\n\nMaintenance and/or replacement of assets by third-party providers shall be governed by suitable agreements implemented in line with our Supplier Due Diligence Policy, and shall include the requirement to maintain the confidentiality of any data that may still remain on assets being replaced or repaired.\n\nWhere assets that are being replaced or decommissioned still store data, administrators shall ensure that they are securely destroyed in line with this policy.\n\nWhere equipment is co-located in third-party data centres, administrators must adhere to visitor and access policies of the third-party data centres at all times.\n\nWhere necessary, suitable power generators shall be installed to maintain the required availability of critical assets.\n\nAll physical assets shall be maintained in line with the recommended maintenance guidance from the vendor or manufacturer. Where there are exceptions identified, such as with legacy systems, this shall be risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that suitable maintenance agreements for assets are put in place to support our organisation's availability, performance, capacity, and supply chain requirements.\n\nAdministrators shall provide suitable security cables to users issued with laptops.\n\nControlling Malware\n\nMalware is a common tool used to disrupt and destroy information systems, and can include viruses, ransomware, rootkits, spyware, botnets, etc. which may then contribute to other types of malicious attacks, such as DoS and DDoS attacks. Administrators shall implement appropriate controls to prevent malware from infecting and spreading on our IT systems. Administrators shall apply the following policies for controlling malware.\n\nAnti-virus\n\nWhere possible, regular endpoint security reviews shall be conducted to monitor and manage anti-virus clients installed on all applicable endpoints that are on, or connect to, our company network, including cloud-based infrastructure.\n\nEndpoints shall include laptops, computers, mobile phones, and servers, whether physical or virtual.\n\nWhere the anti-virus client cannot be installed or used on an endpoint, such as with unsupported mobile devices, virtual instances and cloud containers, etc. the endpoint shall be risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process\n\nTo determine the level of risk, and any suitable controls that may remediate the risk, such as file change monitoring, additional server hardening, access control, network segregation, etc. These endpoints shall be identified and assessed separately, as appropriate.\n\nWhere a centralised antivirus platform is not possible or available, a risk assessment shall be performed in line with our Risk Management Process to determine the level of risk, and any suitable compensating controls.\n\nAnti-virus clients shall be configured to update regularly from the centralised anti-virus platform, or from the vendor where the anti-virus software is standalone or unmanaged. Anti-virus clients shall be configured to prevent tampering. Where possible, alerting should be implemented on anti-virus software to indicate:\n\nWhen anti-virus definitions are out-of-date\n\nWhen potential malicious activity is detected\n\nWhen the software is tampered with\n\nWhere alerts cannot be logged and monitored centrally, proper functioning of the anti-virus client shall be verified by administrators at scheduled intervals. The review schedule shall be dependent on the criticality assigned to the endpoint, and administrators shall ensure that any potential malware infections detected are investigated and removed.\n\nWhere personal devices are used, administrators shall direct users to the Information Security Policy and assist line managers in determining a suitable solution for malware control. Administrators should identify all endpoints which fall under BYOD through regular endpoint security reviews.\n\nPersonal and host-based firewalls\n\nWhere possible, personal or host-based firewalls shall be enabled on all applicable endpoints that are on, or connected to, our company network, including cloud-based endpoints.\n\nEndpoints shall include laptops, computers, and servers, whether physical or virtual.\n\nEndpoint firewalls shall be configured to prevent tampering.\n\nWhere possible, alerting should be implemented to indicate:\n\nWhen the firewall is tampered with\n\nWhere alerts cannot be logged and monitored centrally, proper functioning of the firewall shall be verified by administrators at scheduled intervals. The review schedule shall be dependent on the criticality assigned to the endpoint, and administrators shall ensure that any potential malicious activity detected is investigated.\n\nEmail and web filtering\n\nEmail and internet services are frequently used to launch malicious attacks such as phishing and ransomware attacks. Reducing the likelihood that malicious emails will be delivered to users, or that users will be able to browse to malicious sites, reduces the risk of malware infection, and any impacts that may have on the security of our information and information systems. The following policies apply:\n\nAdministrators shall implement email and web filtering services for company email and internet.\n\nFiltering services shall be configured to update regularly so that the latest attacks and malicious sites are identified.\n\nWeb filtering controls shall be implemented in line with HR requirements such as enhanced protection is enabled on the default browser and HTTPS Only-mode is enabled.\n\nWhere possible, alerting should be implemented to at least indicate:\n\nWhen large volumes of spam are received (may indicate an attack or infected endpoint)\n\nWhen large numbers of false-positives are identified (poor configuration of the filtering software may lead to disruptions in operations)\n\nSoftware and application installation control\n\nAdministrators shall identify approved software and applications in the Approved Applications Register.\n\nEndpoints shall include company laptops, mobile phones, computers, networking devices, and servers, whether physical or virtual.\n\nWhere the software, application, or utility does not require elevated account privileges to be installed or run, or where the utility can override privilege requirements, these software programmes shall be identified and verified by administrators at scheduled intervals. The review schedule shall be dependent on the criticality assigned to the endpoint, and administrators shall ensure that any potential malicious activity detected is investigated.\n\nControlling Removable Media\n\nRemovable media includes, but is not limited to, USBs, CDs, DVDs, mobile phone storage, external hard-drives, backup tape media, etc. While removable media, and particularly USBs, are sometimes used to introduce malicious software and applications to company endpoints and networks, their primary purpose is to store and transfer data. Company data stored on removable media may be easily lost or stolen due to its portability. Removable media therefore poses a risk to the security of our IT systems and information. In the nature of Evercam operations there are no removable media utilised. In case of an ad-hoc scenario or job the following policies shall apply:\n\nWhere possible, administrators shall implement controls to block the use of removable media on all endpoints.\n\nEndpoints shall include company laptops, computers, mobile phones, networking devices, and servers, whether physical or virtual.\n\nIn situations where the use of removable media is unavoidable, the following controls shall be used:\n\nUSBs, external hard-drives, and SD cards shall be issued only by an authorised administrator, and shall be appropriately scanned and encrypted before use\n\nAuthorised administrators shall ensure that issued USBs, external hard-drives, and SD cards are recorded and tracked in the Equipment Register in line with section 3.1 of this document\n\nOnly company mobile phones which are appropriately managed shall be authorised to connect to company endpoints. Users shall not be permitted to connect personal mobile phones to company endpoints. Managed mobile phones shall be appropriately scanned and encrypted before use, and shall have remote wipe functionality enabled\n\nCDs and DVDs shall be appropriately scanned before use\n\nAdministrators should not provide users with CD/DVD burning facilities, wherever possible\n\nWhere tape media are required for information backup, data should be encrypted if possible, and only authorised administrators shall be permitted to handle backup tape media\n\nAll removable media shall be handled in line with the data transfer requirements documented in our Information Security Policy\n\nControlling Mobile Devices\n\nEvercam follows Bring your own device policy (BYOD). Where appropriate, the use of personal mobile devices is allowed as documented in our Information Security Policy. If a company phone is issued the device needs to be appropriately controlled in order to maintain the security of the information and services it may access and store. The following policies for securing mobile devices shall apply to company issued phones.\n\nMobile phones\n\nIf a company phone is issued it shall be recorded and tracked in the Equipment Register\n\nWherever possible, administrators should use an MDM solution to easily onboard and manage company mobile phones. Where an MDM solution is not available, solutions such as Exchange ActiveSync, Microsoft 365 Basic Mobility and Security, anti-virus mobile device controls, etc. should be investigated and implemented. Where no centralised management of mobile phones is available, administrators shall configure each company phone with a security baseline before it is issued to the user. Administrators shall configure the following minimum set of security controls for company mobile devices:\n\nThe device must be password protected with at least a PIN\n\nThe PIN shall be a minimum of 6 numbers\n\nThe device shall be configured to lock itself when it has been idle for more than 1 minute\n\nWhere possible, installation of apps shall be restricted, and only approved apps shall be installed\n\nOnly mobile phones with operating systems that use encryption as default shall be used\n\nWhere possible, the device shall be configured to support features to locate and/or remote wipe the device\n\nAnti-malware software shall be installed\n\nThe device shall be configured to automatically update\n\nAdministrators shall ensure company mobile phones are not jailbroken or rooted.\n\nAdministrators shall facilitate the installation of MDM software on personal mobile phones where requested by the user, and approved by their line manager.\n\nLaptops\n\nEvercam follows Bring your own device policy (BYOD) thus, it is expected that each employee is responsible for safe and secure use of their own work devices (laptops). The following rules apply:\n\nAll devices used for work must have company-approved antivirus and anti-malware software installed and kept up-to-date.\n\nDevices must be kept up to date with the latest security patches and updates.\n\nDevices should be password protected.\n\nMFA should be enabled to access company applications (Google and Zoho).\n\nCompany information cannot be stored on local device Save (documents to be saved on relevant Google Shared Drive / Zoho Work Drive).\n\nEmployees should not attempt to log into company applications (Zoho and Google) with a private user account.\n\nEmployees should not install unverified/unapproved applications or software.\n\nEmployees should ensure that their endpoint devices are adequately encrypted.\n\nLost or stolen devices must be reported to their immediate head and Support - Tech Ops department immediately (contact support@evercam.io).\n\nFor system update and recommended security settings go to\n\nEvercam IT Security Guide\n\nLink: /s/2c280020-8de7-44b6-bf48-aa15a75b3b42/doc/system-updates-security-guide-39d9vgQuwB\n\n.\n\nIf an employee is found in breach of the above security recommendations they might be subject to  Disciplinary action.\n\nHardening & Patching\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities can be introduced to our IT systems and information assets through misconfiguration, software bugs, and other weaknesses. To ensure that our IT systems and information assets are protected against these types of vulnerabilities, the following policies shall apply:\n\nAdministrators shall develop, document, and implement appropriate hardening controls for critical assets, whether they are virtual or physical devices, software, or services. Implementing the hardening guides will ensure that the assets have a minimum set of security controls configured before they are deployed to our organisation's network, or rolled-out to users.\n\nThese configuration controls should include, but may not be limited to:\n\nDisabling and/or removing all unnecessary services and applications\n\nEnsuring that operating systems and applications used are appropriately licensed, and patched to the latest approved versions\n\nManaging stored data so that test and/or configuration data is removed from the asset before deployment\n\nEncrypting drives and/or data stores with encryption at rest wherever necessary\n\nImplementing privileged access controls\n\nEnforcing 2FA for cloud-based software and services\n\nChanging default operating system and application credentials\n\nDisabling generic and/or default accounts wherever possible\n\nIf applicable, iInstalling anti-malware (or software firewall) controls as documented in this policy\n\nIf applicable, blocking removable media as documented in this policy\n\nImplementing controls for resource consumption to limit the impact of DDoS, or other capacity issues that might cause the asset to become unavailable\n\nEnabling alerts and logging as documented in this policy\n\nAdministrators shall review critical assets at regular intervals to ensure that security controls are implemented in line with the established hardening guides.\n\nAdministrators shall review established hardening guides at regular intervals to ensure they remain up-to-date in line with best practice recommendations, and available threat intelligence as documented in this policy.\n\nAdministrators shall maintain awareness of vulnerabilities and threats as documented in this policy and shall implement appropriate patching cycles for networking devices, and servers, whether physical or virtual. Patching cycles should take into consideration the criticality of the assets and associated services.\n\nAdministrators shall review patch levels at regular intervals and ensure that all endpoints are appropriately patched and up-to-date.\n\nAdministrators shall obtain the latest patches only from approved vendors, and shall verify  the authenticity of any downloaded patches before deployment. Evercam utilises a CI/CD (continuous integration & continuous deployment) strategy. Daily and weekly updates are automatically deployed into production in minor versions including patches, bug fixes, and small improvements. Big and important feature changes are planned in monthly or bi-monthly updates.\n\nSecure Disposal\n\nInformation stored on assets can potentially be recovered even after they are removed from our organisation's network, and disposed of. Disposal of any asset containing company data must therefore be done securely, ensuring that any information remaining is no longer readable. The following policies shall apply:\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that all company external hard-drives, and SD cards that are wiped before users departure, ensure that new users cannot read or access previously stored data or user accounts.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that all company endpoints that are end-of-life and due for destruction are securely destroyed either by:\n\nPhysical destruction such as shredding\n\nSecure erasure of data by authorised data erasure providers\n\nSecure erasure using approved data destruction software\n\nSecure erasure services provided by the applicable cloud-service provider\n\nErasure of encryption keys (cryptographic erasure can render the data unrecoverable if the encryption algorithm is a minimum of 128-bits)\n\nWhen using third-parties to destroy assets and associated data, administrators shall ensure that certificates of destruction are received, and that these are retained as evidence.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that the assets are securely transferred to, or collected by, the third-party in line with the policy for physical data transfer in our Information Security Policy.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that the Equipment Register is appropriately updated with the Date of Disposal, and the location of applicable certificates of destruction, where available.\n\nSystem Continuity & Information Backup\n\nSituations may occur where an IT system or information asset is compromised or fails, despite having the required controls in place. When this happens, it should be possible to restore the IT system or information asset, and recover the information to an acceptable level. The following policies shall apply for IT systems and information backup:\n\nAdministrators shall review our organisation's Critical Asset Register in conjunction with our Equipment Register, and shall identify appropriate system recovery and information backup procedures for all required assets in line with our organisation's business requirements.\n\nAdministrators shall document the system recovery and information backup procedures in formal Disaster Recovery Procedure/s, and shall make sure these are made available to all persons involved in the recovery procedures.\n\nAdministrators shall perform system recovery, and information backup and recovery procedures, in line with our documented Disaster Recovery Procedure/s.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that system recovery procedures and information backups are reviewed and tested at regular intervals so that any failures can be investigated and corrected as soon as possible. When working with IaaS and virtualised environments, site mirroring and server or database cloning activities should be logged and monitored, and logs should be checked at intervals appropriate to the criticality of the environment. Where working with PaaS environments, appropriate redundancy measures should be identified and confirmed in line with the Supplier Due Diligence Policy.\n\nInformation Protection\n\nThere may be situations where additional technical protections are required to further restrict the access, copying, and sharing of sensitive or confidential data stored on, or processed using, our information assets. These additional technical protections are typically referred to as data masking and data loss prevention (DLP), or data leakage prevention techniques. The following policies shall apply for identifying and implementing suitable information protection techniques, where required:\n\nAdministrators shall work with data owners in line with sections 1.8.1 and 1.8.2 of the Data Handling & Retention Guidelines to identify appropriate technical controls for the protection of the information the data owner is responsible for. Types of additional controls may include, but are not limited to:\n\nEncryption\n\nMasking out\n\nPseudonymisation\n\nEmail DLP\n\nEndpoint DLP\n\nCloud-based information protection and governance systems\n\nDownload restriction\n\nRemovable device restriction\n\nThe extent and type of technical controls identified shall depend on the level of risk associated with the processing of the data, and the business, legal, regulatory, and/or contractual requirements applicable to our organisation. Data owners and administrators shall ensure the risk assessments are carried out in line with our Risk Management Process, and that suitable controls for data masking and DLP are implemented, where required.\n\nWhen determining whether additional technical controls are required, administrators shall take into consideration the access, network, and cryptographic controls already implemented in line with this policy.\n\nWhere it is determined that the logging and monitoring of copying or export operations associated with sensitive or confidential information is required, administrators shall ensure these activities are logged and monitored in line with this policy.\n\nProtecting Networks & Communications\n\nOur organisation's network is an important part of providing information services both internally to our users, and externally to our clients and other third-parties, and can be physical, virtual, cloud-based, or a combination. Our network, and communications technologies that we may use as part of that network, shall be appropriately protected to minimise any information security risks in line with our business requirements. The following policies apply for securing our network.\n\nSecure Network Design\n\nWhen designing the network, administrators shall apply the principle of defence in depth to ensure that information systems and assets are protected according to their criticality by applying multiple security controls such as those documented in this policy, and other network security controls such as IPS, IDS, etc.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that appropriate firewall and routing technologies are implemented to secure the network perimeter and restrict network traffic to only authorised traffic.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that all network routing rules are configured to deny traffic by default.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that NAT is implemented wherever possible so that internal resources are not routable from public networks such as the internet.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that the network is appropriately segregated so that compromise of one part of the network does not result in the entire network being compromised. For example, by using VLANs, subnets, VPCs, DMZs, multiple domains, etc.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that network interfaces are configured to prevent access from unapproved devices and network traffic, or that they are not reachable from network segments with lower levels of security such as public networks, DMZs, etc.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that industry standard cabling is used to support our organisation's capacity and performance requirements. Administrators shall ensure that service providers providing internet connectivity and/or cloud-based network infrastructure meet our organisation's performance, capacity, and availability requirements. Where necessary, secondary service providers shall be used for redundancy, and networks shall be appropriately configured to fail-over when required.\n\nWhere a number of mobile devices are used to connect to the network, administrators should consider implementing device authentication mechanisms such as RADIUS servers and Network Access Control (NAC), where appropriate.\n\nAdministrators shall not use deprecated and/or unsecure protocols such as telnet, SSL, and versions of SNMP prior to SNMPv3. Administrators shall maintain awareness of vulnerabilities and threats as documented in this policy, and ensure network protocols are appropriately secured and/or disabled where necessary.\n\nUsing Wi-Fi\n\nWhere Wi-Fi is used in our organisation's offices, the following policies shall apply:\n\nAdministrators shall ensure WPA2 is used to encrypt wireless traffic.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that Wireless Access Points (WAPs) are placed in locations where they cannot be unplugged or damaged, which may cause disruption to users and services.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that wireless traffic is appropriately segmented from the network where required. For example, where guest networks are provided for visitors, or where users are not permitted to access certain services from the wireless network.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is disabled.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure the SSID of the wireless network is appropriately controlled. Controls may include:\n\nDisabling broadcast of the SSID\n\nRenaming of the SSID so that it is not easily identifiable as belonging to our organisation\n\nReducing the power level of the broadcast signal so that it is not easily accessible from outside of our offices\n\nAdministrators shall implement authentication mechanisms for wireless devices to reduce the risk of unapproved devices connecting to the network. Authentication controls may include:\n\nMAC address filtering\n\nNetwork security key rotation\n\nRADIUS\n\nSecurity certificates\n\nExternal Access & Connections\n\nWhere remote access to network resources is provided, administrators shall implement a suitable VPN for approved users and/or third-parties. The VPN shall include, but may not be limited to, the following controls:\n\nSupport for strong, industry standard encryption\n\nWhere a site-to-site VPN is used, routing and firewall rules shall be configured to deny all unapproved traffic\n\nWherever possible, 2FA should be used for authentication e.g. user credentials and security token\n\nPublic-facing services that facilitate the transfer of data across the internet and/or uncontrolled third-party networks shall be encrypted using strong, industry standard encryption.\n\nPublic-facing services that facilitate the transfer of data across the internet and/or uncontrolled third-party networks shall use strong authentication mechanisms such as 2FA, security tokens, cryptographic keys, etc. wherever possible to minimise the risk of unauthorised access.\n\nWhere third-parties require access to our network, administrators shall ensure that the external access is restricted to only authorised IP addresses and ranges, where possible.\n\nUsing Encryption\n\nServices used on our organisation's network shall be configured to encrypt their data in transit wherever possible. For example:\n\nWhere LDAP is a required service, LDAPS should be implemented\n\nWhere FTP is a required service, SFTP should be implemented\n\nWhere SNMP is required, SNMPv3 with authPriv should be implemented\n\nIn cloud-based infrastructure, administrators shall ensure that network traffic between virtual machines, routers, data containers, backup images, etc. are encrypted in transit wherever possible.\n\nNetwork Architecture with Encryption\n\nLink: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12HIP58bma_XWnGqJjJyNk3YTJh0Q1o7RcFp5mSaDQQI/edit\n\nControlling Access\n\nImplementing appropriate access controls for information and associated information assets is essential to minimising the risk of unauthorised access, data breach, accidental modification, and other malicious or damaging activities that may originate from both inside and outside of our organisation. Information and associated information assets must be protected according to their classification, our business requirements, and our legal and regulatory requirements as documented in our Information Security Policy. Access control shall be implemented so that only authorised users have access to information and associated information assets. This section sets out our requirements for access control.\n\nManaging Passwords\n\nOne of the standard methods of authenticating access to IT systems and information is by using password management systems. The use of passwords and account controls has changed over time, and some password management systems no longer require rotation and expiry of passwords, but instead enforce passwords of greater length and complexity, along with secondary authentication such as biometrics, security tokens, device registration, etc. The following policies shall apply for our organisation.\n\nChoosing a password management system\n\nAdministrators shall ensure password management systems used for accessing an information system or service are risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process and that controls appropriate to the criticality of the system are identified and implemented.\n\nWhere appropriate access controls cannot be implemented, administrators should avoid using the information system or service where possible.\n\nWhere possible, administrators should consider the use of Single Sign-On (SSO) to ensure user account policy controls are applied consistently across information systems of similar criticalities, and to improve the security of registration and de-registration procedures.\n\nWhere information systems are accessible from the internet, administrators shall ensure that the password management system can implement 2FA.\n\nAt a minimum, the password management system should ensure administrators can configure the following account policy controls:\n\nPasswords with a minimum number of characters\n\nPasswords with a mix of numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and special symbols such as (*%!&) that prevent the use of dictionary words\n\nForced password expiry so that new passwords must be used periodically\n\nMinimum password reset time\n\nA password history so that passwords cannot be re-used frequently\n\nAccount lockout on repeated failure attempts to prevent brute-forcing of accounts. Administrators should use caution when implementing account lockout for some services as brute-force attacks may result in DoS where multiple accounts may become locked and inaccessible.\n\nOne-time use passwords\n\nAdministrators shall ensure the system masks passwords when entered so that they are not visible to other persons.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure the system does not allow passwords to be sent in the clear across the network or public-facing networks such as the internet.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure the system does not allow the enumeration of account usernames by allowing valid accounts to be identified. For example, where the user enters their password incorrectly, the system shall not indicate that authentication failed due to an incorrect password. In this scenario, a malicious attacker would then know that the username is valid, and may attempt to brute-force the account.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that the system does not store account passwords with reversible encryption.\n\nManaging user accounts\n\nAdministrators shall create, modify, or disable user accounts in line with our Joiners/Movers/Leavers Procedure (JML Procedure).\n\nAdministrators shall assign account permissions according to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users are only given access to information and systems they are authorised to use.\n\nAdministrators shall use appropriate access controls to restrict user access to information in line with business requirements. Controls may include, but may not be limited to:\n\nMandatory Access Controls for restricting Highly Confidential data\n\nRole-based Access Control for assigning permissions based on the user's role and responsibilities\n\nWhere a user requests access to a system, service, and/or information, administrators shall confirm the access request with manager and the asset owner identified in Access Control Policy, or the asset owner identified in the Critical Asset Register. The asset owner assigned in the Critical Asset Register shall take precedence if ownership is unclear.\n\nAt a minimum, administrators shall configure the user account policy to require the following:\n\nPasswords with a minimum of 8 characters\n\nForced password expiry of 90 days unless 2FA is required\n\nA minimum password reset time of 1 day to prevent users from resetting their password too frequently\n\nA password history of at least 10 passwords to prevent frequent re-use of passwords\n\nAccount lockout of 30 minutes on 5 failed logon attempts. The account should automatically unlock after the 30 minute period, or IT can manually unlock the account upon request\n\nPassword reset on first logon or following manual password reset\n\nAdministrators shall ensure 2FA is enabled for users, where possible.\n\nAdministrators shall assign each user with a unique ID.\n\nAdministrators shall not re-use user IDs.\n\nWhen resetting passwords, or providing passwords to new users, administrators shall ensure a one-time password is used\n\nAdministrators shall not request users' passwords from them for any reason. When requiring access for support purposes, administrators shall reset the user's account before and after use, and only with user permission.\n\nAdministrators shall always confirm the identity of the user before responding to account reset requests.\n\nAdministrators shall perform user account and permissions audits at planned intervals, and shall ensure that the accounts and assigned permissions are reviewed and confirmed by line managers and/or asset owners, as appropriate.\n\nAll unused accounts shall be disabled.\n\nManaging privileged accounts\n\nAdministrators shall identify and document all privileged accounts used to perform administrative operations.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that account privileges are granted and maintained based on the Access Control Policy.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that only authorised accounts are used to perform their required administrative operations.\n\nWhen creating privileged accounts, the account name shall not easily identify the purpose of the account. For example, ExchangeAdminAccount, ActiveDirectoryAdministrator, etc.\n\nAdministrators shall avoid using root accounts wherever possible. Administrators should rather create new privileged accounts for the required roles and ensure root credentials are kept secure.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that privileged accounts are used by authorised persons only.\n\nWhere accessing systems over the internet or other unmanaged networks using privileged accounts, 2FA shall be enabled\n\nAt a minimum, privileged accounts shall require the following policy:\n\nPasswords with a minimum of 12 characters\n\nWhere possible, administrators shall periodically reset privileged account passwords, and when persons with knowledge of privileged accounts leave the organisation.\n\nAdministrators shall periodically audit privileged accounts to ensure these are appropriately controlled.\n\nManaging generic accounts\n\nGeneric and service accounts may be used to run unattended operations, background services, provide temporary user or guest access, provide access to a shared account, etc. The following policy applies for managing generic and service accounts:\n\nAdministrators shall not create generic accounts for guest or temporary users. Each user must be provided with an account with a unique ID so that activity is auditable.\n\nWhere necessary, administrators can provide delegated permissions for an agreed period of time in situations where account sharing is unavoidable. This will ensure passwords and user IDs are not shared. Administrators shall confirm the request with the account and/or asset owner before delegating permissions.\n\nAdministrators shall identify and document all service accounts used to perform service operations.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that each service account is only permitted to access the services and information assets it is authorised to access.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that service accounts are not added to security or other privileged groups with permissions higher than it requires.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that all unnecessary rights are removed from service accounts.\n\nAdministrators shall periodically audit service accounts to ensure these are appropriately controlled.\n\nCryptographic Controls\n\nOur organisation primarily uses cryptographic controls to protect the confidentiality and integrity of our data by encrypting it in transit and at rest, and to provide authentication to access IT systems and information assets by using public/private key pairs. This section sets out our requirements for managing cryptographic controls. The following policies apply:\n\nAdministrators shall ensure all IT systems and information assets are encrypted as required by this Policy. For example, Wi-Fi shall be encrypted using WPA2, Network services should be encrypted where possible, etc.\n\nWhere cryptographic controls are not explicitly mentioned in this document, administrators shall ensure that all IT systems and information assets are risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process to determine whether cryptographic controls are required, and what level of control is appropriate.\n\nAdministrators shall not use bespoke encryption or hashing algorithms. Administrators shall maintain awareness of security standards as documented in this policy, and use only strong, industry standard algorithms. Examples may include:\n\nApplication\n\nEncryption Type\n\nWeb-portals, websites, SaaS applications using HTTPS, Zoho Mail\n\nMinimum of TLSv1.2 and AES-256\n\nLaptop disk encryption\n\nNo company issued laptops. BYOD Policy guidelines on system inbuilt encryptions on employees’ devices apply.\n\nPassword storage\n\nZoho Vault security. All users' passwords are encrypted using Bcrypt.\n\nVPN\n\nVPN infrastructure is standalone using WireGuard.\n\nAdministrators shall not use deprecated algorithms, or algorithms with known vulnerabilities.\n\nManaging Cryptographic Keys\n\nOur organisation may generate cryptographic keys for the following reasons, and should not be considered exhaustive:\n\nTo provide access to information assets and IT systems such as servers, databases, networking devices, cloud-based infrastructure, etc. whether physical or virtual\n\nTo encrypt data at rest such as with full disk encryption on laptops, data storage, backup tapes, etc.\n\nTo encrypt individual files or emails, etc.\n\nGenerating security certificates for protecting public-facing applications\n\nThe following policies apply:\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that a centralised key management system (KMS) is used, where possible. When maintaining cloud-based infrastructure, administrators should use KMS services provided, where available and appropriate.\n\nWhere keys cannot be centrally managed, administrators shall identify appropriate procedures for recording and storing keys.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that access to key generation is restricted to authorised persons only.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that keys are stored securely with restricted access, and are appropriately backed up to ensure that loss of the key store does not result in the loss of access to critical IT systems and information assets.\n\nAdministrators shall periodically test recovery of keys to ensure keys can be restored. Administrators shall implement procedures for rotating keys at regular intervals.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure keys are revoked in situations where the key may have become compromised, or when persons with knowledge of, or previous access to, keys leave the organisation.\n\nWhere possible, administrators shall configure keys to expire, and shall develop procedures for updating expired keys.\n\nAdministrators shall periodically review keys to ensure they are rotated, revoked, and expired as required.\n\nWhere using public-key infrastructure (PKI), administrators shall ensure that certificate authorities (CAs) and registration authorities (RAs) are trusted.\n\nLogging and Monitoring\n\nTo assist in identifying issues such as malicious activity, misconfigurations, incidents, security incidents, service failures, etc. it is critical that our organisation ensure that activities that take place on our organisation's network, IT systems, and information assets are appropriately logged and monitored. This section sets out our requirements for the auditing and review of logging information. The following policies apply:\n\nAdministrators shall ensure all IT systems and information assets are audited and monitored as required by this Information Systems Security Policy and Audit Log Management Policy.\n\nWhere requirements for logging and monitoring are not explicitly mentioned in this document, administrators shall ensure that all IT systems and information assets are risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process to determine whether logging and monitoring is required, and what level of logging is appropriate.\n\nWhere possible, administrators shall ensure that all IT systems and information assets are configured with a single time source. The time source shall be a trusted, external source. Ensuring system clocks are synchronised across information assets will ensure log data can be accurately compared when investigating incidents and troubleshooting issues.\n\nWhere possible, a security information and event management (SIEM) system should be used to centralise the capture and monitoring of log data.\n\nThe level of logging configured shall be appropriate to the criticality of the information asset. Log data should include, but may not be limited to:\n\nDate and time data\n\nAccess control events such as log on, log off, login failure/success events, etc. The use of service accounts and utility programmes that are restricted\n\nModification of particular files, services, configurations, etc.\n\nService and application faults\n\nAdministrators shall review log data at regular intervals to minimise the risk of potential security incidents remaining unnoticed. Where possible, alerts shall be configured so that certain log events, or logs generated by critical assets, can be prioritised and responded to appropriately.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that only authorised persons have access to log data. Log data shall be protected from modification and/or deletion at all times.\n\nAdministrators shall not be able to modify and/or delete any administrator or operator logs associated with their own activities.\n\nLog data shall be retained for a minimum of 3 months, or where our organisation's data retention requirements may require additional retention times.\n\nSystem Testing\n\nAs changes are made to our IT systems, services, and information assets, new vulnerabilities and weaknesses may be introduced. New threats are also emerging on a daily basis. Independent system testing at planned intervals can assist in ensuring that our IT systems and information assets continue to be adequately protected in line with our organisation's requirements. The following policies for system testing shall apply:\n\nRequired testing activities shall be identified based on the criticality of the system or asset.\n\nAdministrators shall ensure a risk assessment is carried out in line with our Risk Management Process to ensure appropriate levels and frequency of testing are identified.\n\nAll testing shall be appropriately planned and scoped so that business operations are not negatively impacted. System testers shall not exceed the scope of the planned testing activities.\n\nSystem testers shall be appropriately trained to carry out the testing activity. Where necessary, third-party security analysts and penetration testers should be contracted to perform testing activities.\n\nSystem testers shall be independent i.e. they shall not test information systems or assets that they are responsible for administering. System testers shall give asset owners advanced notice of any testing being carried out, and shall obtain permission from the asset owner.\n\nWhere testing may include cloud-based services and infrastructure, or other third-party providers, system testers must obtain permission from the cloud-service provider and/or third-party to carry out the testing.\n\nSystem testers shall record the results of their tests, and provide recommendations for remediation.\n\nWhere weaknesses are identified, administrators shall perform a risk assessment in line with our Risk Management Process.\n\nIdentifying & Reporting Incidents\n\nAdministrators play a key role in the identification and reporting of potential security incidents, and are frequently first responders. Where a potential security incident has been reported, either by a user, another administrator, or in situations where an administrator notices a potential incident themselves, the following policies shall apply:\n\nAdministrators shall adhere to our Incident Response Procedure and alert our Incident Response Team (IRT) to the incident. The IRT will determine next steps for handling the incident.\n\nAdministrators shall not attempt to trace or track a malicious attacker. Priority shall be given to alerting the IRT and following our Incident Response Procedure. Where an administrator prioritises catching a potential malicious attacker, this may increase the impact of the attack on our information systems and assets.\n\nAdministrators shall assist users in performing initial containment activities such as disabling network connectivity, unplugging removable media, etc.\n\nAdministrators shall participate in regular incident response training exercises to ensure that they are familiar with our Incident Response Procedure.\n\nPerforming Reviews\n\nLike security testing, auditing and review activities are essential to ensure that the development, management, and maintenance of our IT systems and information assets remain in line with the requirements of this policy. Review activities will also assist in identifying potential improvements. The following policies apply for performing reviews:\n\nAdministrators shall ensure all review activities are performed as required by this Information Systems Security Policy.\n\nWhere requirements for performing reviews or audits are not explicitly mentioned in this document, administrators shall ensure that all IT systems and information assets are risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process to determine whether periodic review or auditing is required.\n\nAdministrators shall retain evidence of review or auditing activities. Evidence may include, but may not be limited:\n\nChecklists that contain the date, what was checked, and who carried out the check\n\nReports containing testing results\n\nUser lists with last login information and confirmation of permissions from line managers or asset owners, as appropriate\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that evidence of review or auditing activities is controlled, and protected from unauthorised access and tampering.\n\nCreated by: Compliance Manager (ISMS team)\n\nCreation date: 01.08.2023\n\nLast modification date: 09.01.2025\n\nDocument approver: Director of support"

    "text": "Purpose\n\nOur organisation relies on third-party providers to assist us in delivering services, not only to our customers, but also internally. They are crucial to meeting our business objectives, but can also introduce risks to our operational and data processing activities where they do not apply the same level of information security controls, and do not meet our requirements for capacity and availability. To ensure that we minimise risks associated with the use of third-parties, we must establish clearly defined relationships with them by leveraging a due diligence programme that includes SLAs, contracts, and supplier review activities.\n\nManagement is committed to ensuring our relationships with our third-parties are managed in line with our security requirements, and have developed and approved this supplier due diligence policy in line with the ISO 27001 standard for information security, and our organisation's business requirements.\n\nThis document sets out the approved supplier due diligence policy so that it can be clearly communicated to all employees, contractors, and third-parties who have responsibilities for contracting and managing suppliers.\n\nScope\n\nThis policy shall apply to the management of all suppliers that have a role in operating and/or providing services that fall within the scope of our organisation's ISMS. Services could include facilities management, cloud-services, web apps, software development, etc.\n\nAudience\n\nAll employees, contractors, and third-parties who have responsibility for the procurement and management of suppliers and third-party services shall adhere to this Supplier Due Diligence Policy. These include, but are not limited to, the following roles:\n\nSenior management\n\nManagers\n\nDepartment heads\n\nLine managers\n\nAsset owners\n\nBusiness owners\n\nData protection managers\n\nManaged services providers\n\nFor the purposes of this document, employees, contractors, and third-parties who carry out these roles shall be collectively referred to as \"supplier relationship managers\".\n\nCommunication\n\nThis Supplier Due Diligence Policy shall be communicated to all employees and agency staff as part of the relevant department training programme, and periodically following any changes to the policy. All contractors and third-parties involved in managing suppliers and third-party services on our behalf shall be provided with a copy of this policy as part of the process for contracting services. Contractors and third-parties shall be re-issued with updated versions of this policy periodically, and following any changes.\n\nDisciplinary Process\n\nWhere a supplier relationship manager knowingly engages in a relationship with a third-party in breach of this Supplier Due Diligence Policy, they shall be subject to the disciplinary process documented in the Company Manual, or the applicable service contract. Improvement\n\nManagement is committed to the continual improvement of our Supplier Due Diligence Policy, and shall review this document on an annual basis, or whenever an independent review of our organisation's ISMS reveals a non-conformance or opportunity for improvement. The Management Review shall determine if this policy continues to meet the requirements of our organisation.\n\nManagement also endeavours to plan our business operations so that our procurement and management of services is not misused, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is done by identifying and assigning separate duties and responsibilities to guard against misuses such as fraud, or creating situations where there is a conflict of interest, etc. Where a supplier relationship manager identifies potential conflicts or misuse due to improper planning and assignment of duties, they should raise their concern immediately with their line manager, or the ISMS Manager.\n\nChoosing Suppliers\n\nOur third-party providers frequently become our partners in the delivery of our business services, and supplier selection must therefore be done in a controlled way that minimises potential risks to our information systems and information. Our primary goal is to ensure a relationship of trust with our third-party providers, based on:\n\nClear communication of our requirements from the procurement stage, and throughout the lifetime of the relationship.\n\nAppropriate and regular review and monitoring, based on the type of services provided and the potential associated risks.\n\nOpen and collaborative engagement where both parties can communicate potential or ongoing issues that may impact the required services. This section sets out our criteria for selecting suppliers.\n\nChange Control\n\nThe procurement of a new service, or the change of an existing one, is a change in the way that we operate, and potentially a change to our information systems and the way we process information. Supplier relationship managers shall ensure that all such changes are raised in line with our Change Control Procedure so that change managers can be assigned and properly assess the proposed new supplier, or change in service, and determine whether there is a clear business case, and how our organisation's security and business requirements will be met. The following shall be considered when assessing the change:\n\nThe supplier's ability to adhere to our information security policies.\n\nThe supplier's ability to deliver the service in line with relevant SLAs, including current and projected potential capacity requirements, where relevant.\n\nThe supplier's reliance on sub-processing or fourth-parties to deliver the service.\n\nOur existing contractual requirements, and the impact this change in supplier or provision of services may have on our ability to meet those requirements. Our legal and regulatory requirements, and the impact this change in supplier or provision of services may have on our ability to meet those requirements.\n\nWhat monitoring and review activities will be required to ensure that the third-party continues to meet our security and business requirements. This should be appropriate to the level of risk assigned to the operational and processing activities carried out.\n\nProcurement\n\nWhere there is an established procurement process in their area, supplier relationship managers shall ensure that the process is followed when engaging with a new contract for services, or amending an existing contract. All procurement processes involving third-party providers shall adhere to the security and business requirements set out in this document.\n\nInformation Security in Agreements\n\nTo ensure our requirements for information security and availability are clearly communicated, each supplier relationship shall be governed by an applicable supplier agreement. The level of controls identified for each agreement shall be appropriate to the level of risk associated with the service and/or processing activities that the third-party provider will be carrying out on our behalf.\n\nOnce the new or modified service and supplier has been assessed in line with our Change Control Procedure as required in section 1.1 of this document, supplier relationship managers shall ensure applicable controls are included in the agreement. This section sets out our required controls for supplier agreements. The controls documented below should not be considered exhaustive, and supplier relationship managers may identify other applicable controls.\n\nAll third-party providers must identify a nominated security contact in the supplier agreement. This will not only allow supplier relationship managers to quickly and easily raise security-related concerns to the supplier, but will facilitate the planning and scheduling of monitoring and review activities.\n\nInformation Security Policies & Procedures\n\nSupplier relationship managers shall ensure that all relevant and current information security policies and procedures are provided to third-party providers as part of the process for contracting services, and shall ensure that these are re-issued periodically, and following any changes. All provided information security policies and procedures shall be listed in the agreement, along with their date of issue. This will allow supplier relationship managers to quickly identify which documents have been provided, and if they are current. Third-party providers shall be required to acknowledge receipt of the documents in writing. Where third-parties have determined that they will adhere to their own information security policies and procedures, the third-party shall identify and provide their own corresponding documents. This will allow supplier relationship managers to identify any gaps or issues in policy alignment, and determine documentation for review as part of any monitoring and review activities.\n\nPersonal Data Protection Requirements\n\nThe Data Protection Lead shall be consulted in line with our Change Control Procedure to ensure that all personal data processing requirements are identified. Where the third-party is processing personal data on behalf of our organisation, a contract for data processing shall be put in place that adheres to the applicable data protection laws. No personal data shall be transferred or processed without an agreement in place. Third-parties shall identify a Data Protection Officer or a Data Protection Manager in the agreement so that supplier relationship managers can quickly and easily escalate data processing queries such as personal data requests and potential personal data breach incidents, etc.\n\nLegal & Regulatory Requirements\n\nLegal and regulatory requirements that apply to the service or information processing activities being provided by the third-party may vary depending on the location, type of services being provided, and type of data being processed. For example, where card payment information is being processed, there may be a requirement for the third-party to comply with PCI-DSS. The following policies shall apply: Supplier relationship managers shall ensure that all supplier agreements are reviewed from a legal and regulatory perspective prior to being issued to the third-party provider. Supplier relationship managers shall ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are documented in the agreement. Third-party providers shall be required to acknowledge adherence to the applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Supplier relationship managers shall review agreements they are responsible for at regular intervals, and ensure the legal and regulatory requirements are reviewed and agreed with the third-party, as required.\n\nIntellectual Property & Escrow\n\nSupplier relationship managers shall ensure that ownership for intellectual property is clearly documented in agreements with third-parties. Where necessary, supplier relationship managers shall ensure that provisions for placing source code into escrow are identified and documented in the agreement. Where third-parties provide software development services that may use our own software or code, supplier relationship managers shall ensure that agreements contain controls that prohibit the modification or reverse engineering of our software packages, unless absolutely required to fulfil the contract for services.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nSupplier relationship managers shall ensure that all agreements they are responsible for contain suitable confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). All data transferred to, and/or processed by, third-party providers must be protected from unauthorised disclosure.\n\nFourth-Parties & Supply Chain\n\nThird-party providers shall identify all fourth-parties they engage with for sub-processing and/or service delivery activities in agreements. Sub-contracted organisations can impact the supply chain, and the third-party provider's ability to deliver the services required. Third-party providers shall acknowledge their responsibility for managing relevant fourth-parties in agreements. Third-party providers shall acknowledge that all applicable information security policies and procedures are communicated to fourth-parties.\n\nRight to Audit\n\nSupplier relationship managers shall ensure that the right to audit is included in agreements with third-party providers. The right to audit will include the necessary review and monitoring activities identified in line with section 1.1 of this document. Activities include, but may not be limited to:\n\nVulnerability scanning\n\nPenetration testing\n\nSite visit and physical security audits\n\nReview of applicable information security policies and procedures at regular intervals\n\nConfirmation of the validity of any independent certifications held\n\nEngagement with and completion of required security questionnaires\n\nProvision and review of the results of any self-testing exercises such as service continuity testing, penetration testing, etc. Security awareness training programmes\n\nContinuity of Services\n\nSupplier relationship managers shall ensure that the capacity and availability requirements identified in section 1.1 of this policy are documented in the agreement. Third-party providers shall acknowledge the agreed service levels by including an appropriate SLA in the agreement. Where third-party providers may be required to participate in our own business continuity and incident response testing exercises, supplier relationship managers shall ensure the requirement to participate is included in the agreement.\n\nRetention of Third-Party Certification\n\nIn situations where a valid third-party certification has been provided in lieu of performing certain due diligence activities with a third-party provider, the third-party provider shall include the intention to maintain the certification in the agreement, and provide a copy of the most recent certificate.\n\nTraining\n\nThird-party providers shall provide assurance in agreements that the employees they contract to deliver the service are appropriately vetted and trained to perform the required work.\n\nAgreement Termination\n\nSupplier relationship managers shall ensure that grounds for contract termination are included in the agreement. These should be appropriate to the risk level assigned to the service and/or associated information processing activities. Supplier relationship managers shall ensure a suitable duration for the agreement is set. Agreements shall not be valid for excessively long or short periods of time, but should be appropriate to the criticality of the service and assigned risk level. For example, a contract for facilities management may be valid for 3 years, but a contract to use a cloud-based payroll service may be valid for 1 year, and subject to quarterly review. Third-party providers shall acknowledge that all information provided to them by our organisation will be returned upon termination of the agreement, and shall also stipulate how the information will be returned.\n\nReview & Monitoring\n\nAs mentioned in section 1.1 and section 2.8 of this document, appropriate review and monitoring activities should be identified to ensure that the third-party providers we engage with for services continue to meet their contractual obligations and adhere to our requirements for information security and availability. The following policies for review and monitoring of third-party providers shall apply: The review and monitoring activities identified shall be appropriate to the level of risk assigned to the service and associated information processing activities. The review and monitoring activities identified shall not be excessive, and shall be planned in a way that does not disrupt the business operations of either party. Supplier relationship managers shall ensure that review meetings are held at regular intervals with the third-party providers they are responsible for. The frequency of review meetings shall be based on the level of risk assigned to the service and associated information processing activities. Supplier relationship managers shall ensure that all evidence of review and monitoring activities, such as meeting minutes, testing results, updated policies and procedures, security questionnaires, etc. are retained. Reviewing and monitoring activities should be captured using the Supplier Monitoring Activity Review, where appropriate. Supplier relationship managers shall review agreements with third-party providers at least annually to ensure that the agreement continues to meet our business and security requirements. Where potential changes are identified, these shall be raised with the third-party provider and the agreement updated, where possible. Agreement review activities should be captured using the Supplier Agreement Review, where appropriate. Where a change in agreement is required, or a third-party provider can no longer meet the requirements of an agreement, supplier relationship managers shall notify the ISMS Manager so that a risk assessment can be organised and performed in line with our Risk Management Process. Where review and monitoring activities show that a third-party provider is consistently failing to meet the agreed security and business requirements, the supplier relationship manager shall notify the ISMS Manager so that a risk assessment can be organised and performed in line with our Risk Management Process. Where the third-party is a cloud service provider that provides only standard terms and conditions and does not engage with individual monitoring and review activities, the requirements set out in section 4 this policy shall apply.\n\nCloud Services\n\nOur organisation may choose to engage with third-party providers that provide their services as cloud-based SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS solutions. These services are frequently multi-tenant, and provide only subscription-based and/or on-demand agreements based on a standard set of terms and conditions. In these situations it may not be possible to establish individual agreements with the third-party providers which cover all of our information security and business requirements.\n\nThe following policies shall apply when a cloud-service provider does not offer individual agreement for services: The cloud-service provider shall be carefully assessed in line with our Change Control Procedure to determine if the service meets our security and business requirements, ensuring that any gaps are identified. Where the cloud-service provider uses a shared-responsibility model, it is important to understand what the provider is responsible for, and what our organisation is responsible for. For example, AWS provides identity access controls as a service, but it is the customer's responsibility to ensure the controls are implemented and used in line with organisational security policy. The ISMS Manager shall assist in identifying responsibilities and required security controls for the service in line with our Risk Management Process. Supplier relationship managers shall ensure they subscribe to relevant news or update feeds for the cloud-service provider to remain informed of any service updates and changes to terms and conditions. The Data Protection Lead shall ensure that any processing of personal data complies with applicable data protection laws as part of our Change Control Procedure. Data shall not be transferred illegally. Supplier relationship managers shall ensure that all available information related to the security of the cloud service is reviewed, where available. Where third-party certification and audit reports are provided, these shall be reviewed to confirm the validity of the certification, and that the published scope of the certification includes the services provided to our organisation. Supplier relationship managers shall review agreement information, such as terms of service, subscriptions, and data processing agreements (DPAs), at regular intervals in line with section 3 above. Where use of the cloud-service provider is terminated, supplier relationship managers shall ensure that data is appropriately returned, exported, or deleted either prior to termination, or as part of the termination process. Supplier relationship managers shall confirm access to the service is removed following return, export, or deletion of the data.\n\nExisting Suppliers\n\nOur organisation may have engaged with a number of suppliers prior to the implementation of this Supplier Due Diligence Policy, and therefore these existing providers may not be contractually obligated to meet our requirements for information security. In this situation, the following policies shall apply: The third-party provider shall be risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process to identify any gaps in current security controls. The supplier relationship manager shall engage with the third-party provider to determine if any identified gaps can be remediated, and if the current agreement can be updated to include the current security requirements. Where necessary, management may make the decision to 'grandfather' the service provider to make them exempt from this policy, and accept the associated risk. This shall be recorded in our Risk Register in line with our Risk Management Process.\n\nCreated by: Compliance Manager\n\nCreation date: 27.07.2023\n\nLast modification date:  21.11.2024\n\nDocument approver: Head of Compliance"

    "text": "Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to define the activities associated with the provision of data retention and destruction plans and programs that protect Evercam Limited’s information systems, networks, data, databases and other information assets. Additional policies governing data management activities will be addressed separately.\n\nScope\n\nThe scope of this data retention and destruction policy is all information technology systems, software, databases, applications and network resources needed by Evercam Limited to conduct its business. The policy is applicable to all Company employees, contractors and other authorised third-party organisations.\n\nStatement of Compliance\n\nThis policy is designed to be compliant with the U.S. Data Protection Act of 1998, Freedom of Information Act of 2000, Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 and Europe's General Data Protection Regulation.\n\n\n\nData retention and destruction policy compliance is managed by the IT department, with support from Compliance department leadership and subject matter experts. To achieve compliance, data retention and destruction programs include appropriate procedures, and identify staffing and technology resources to meet compliance requirements. Compliance verification (especially for data destruction) is performed monthly by the IT department, internal audit or other appropriate entity.\n\nPolicy\n\nThe Information Technology (IT) department, with support from the Compliance department, is responsible for managing all data retention and destruction activities for the Company. Other departments, such as Finance and Accounting, Operations and Human Resources, are also responsible for providing the IT and Compliance departments with their requirements for data retention and destruction. The IT and Compliance departments are responsible for developing, executing and periodically testing data retention and destruction procedures. The IT and Compliance departments also acknowledge they will comply with appropriate industry standards for data retention and destruction in its activities.\n\nThe company shall develop comprehensive data retention and destruction plans in accordance with good data management practices as defined by established standards.\n\nData retention and destruction activities shall be performed as part of the company's data management program, which administers and manages the overall technology data management program, which includes:\n\nPlanning and design of data retention and destruction activities;\n\nIdentification of data retention and destruction teams, defining their roles and responsibilities and ensuring they are properly trained and prepared to perform their duties;\n\nPlanning, design and documentation of data retention and destruction plans;\n\nScheduling of updates to data retention and destruction risk analyses;\n\nPlanning and delivery of awareness and training activities for employees and data retention and destruction team members;\n\nPlanning and execution of data retention and destruction plan exercises;\n\nDesigning and implementing data retention and destruction maintenance activities to ensure that plans are up to date and ready for use;\n\nPreparing for management review and auditing of data retention and destruction plan(s); and\n\nPlanning and implementation of continuous improvement activities for data retention and destruction activities and plans.\n\nFormal Risk Assessments (RAs) and Business Impact Analysis (BIAs) shall include requirements for data retention and destruction activities; RAs and BIAs shall be updated at least annually to ensure they are in alignment with the business and its technology requirements.\n\nData retention and destruction plans shall address electronic data stored on electronic media such as CDs, hard disk drives, solid state disk drives, magnetic tape and other appropriate media.\n\nData retention and destruction plans shall address data stored on non-electronic media (e.g., paper files, microfiche).\n\nData retention and destruction plans shall address electronic information systems (e.g., servers, routers, switches) and components (e.g., cabling and connectors, power supplies, storage racks) and other assets that are currently out of production or scheduled to be phased out of production environments.\n\nData retention plans shall establish the storage requirements and associated metrics (e.g., length of storage, type of storage media) for electronic and non-electronic information as well as systems supporting the IT infrastructure.\n\nData destruction plans shall establish the parameters for destruction of electronic data (e.g., overwriting, reformatting, degaussing, firmware-based erasure, physical data media destruction), non-electronic data (e.g., shredding of hard copy), and systems and components (e.g., third-party destruction services).\n\nData retention and destruction plans shall be periodically reviewed and tested in a suitable environment to ensure that data, databases, media, systems and other relevant elements can be retained or destroyed and that Evercam Limited’s management and employees understand how the plans are to be executed as well as their roles and responsibilities.\n\nAll employees must be made aware of the data retention and destruction program and their own roles and responsibilities.\n\nData retention and destruction plans and other documents are to be kept up to date and will reflect existing and changing circumstances.\n\nData Storage\n\nThe cloud recordings are stored on dedicated cloud service providers, primarily on Hetzner servers located in Germany and AWS servers located in Ireland. In addition, physical hard drives are placed at the project site and connected to the cameras for local storage in addition to SD cards located inside the camera. At the end of the project, the customer has the option to retain the physical hard drives or store them securely with us. The SD cards will be destroyed as they only retain 5-7 days worth of data. We take every precaution to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data.\n\nRegular audits are conducted to ensure the integrity and security of the data stored in the cloud and physical hard drives. These routine checks enable us to identify and address any potential issues or concerns promptly, ensuring the safety and confidentiality of our clients' data.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/dc5042fd-c9fa-42fa-9bac-9e9c644400a3/0d2e218f-f8ce-491a-bd77-98b640b7f4ef/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084911Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=2fb077d995cf56eb76eeb9436dd014d09648d6585ed9547881d5e421779885f6&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nData Retention and Destruction Specifications\n\nFollowing are specific data retention and destruction technical requirements:\n\nRetention Periods\n\nEvercam typically stores a copy of client data for 90 days after a project has been completed, unless the client requests to delete the footage earlier. After this period, data storage can be extended at the Client's expense, with several storage options available. The data is stored both on cloud-based servers and physical hard drives for redundancy and backup purposes.\n\nSee also\n\nProject Archiving\n\nLink: https://docs.evercam.io/doc/project-archiving-tgivN5ofTV\n\nData/System Retention\n\nCloud recordings will continue to be stored on dedicated cloud service providers, primarily on Hetzner servers located in Germany for the agreed retention period. Hard drives will be stored in the nearest Evercam HQ for the agreed retention period. Regular audits are conducted to ensure the integrity and security of the data stored in the cloud and physical hard drives. These routine checks enable us to identify and address any potential issues or concerns promptly, ensuring the safety and confidentiality of our clients' data.\n\nOnce the agreed retention period has been reached, the Client will choose from one of the following options:\n\nExtend:\n\nData will continue to be stored by Evercam. The nature of the storage and associated costs to be agreed at the time of extension\n\nTransfer:\n\nData will be transferred to the Client. The manner in how the data is transferred and associated costs to be agreed the time of transfer\n\nDelete:\n\nThe Client will confirm that they will wish for all data to be deleted and Evercam will provide a formal Data Deletion Certificate.\n\nEvercam reserves the right to delete data after the agreed data retention period has expired.\n\nData Retrieval (Hard Drive)\n\nEvercam will engage with the Client nominated site contact to coordinate the removal of the hard drives from the site and for them to be shipped by a trusted courier to the nearest Evercam office (see Appendices). As logistics can vary per site, hard drive retrieval may be carried out by an Evercam nominated 3rd party or in conjunction with the nominated Client site contact. The best approach for each site will be agreed in conjunction with Client.\n\nResponsibility for, and costs of, camera decommissioning and hardware retrieval will be agreed on a per project basis due the logistical variations.\n\nData Recovery, Fire and Theft (Cloud Recording and Local Recordings)\n\nCloud Recordings are stored in ISO27001 certified data centres with their own internal Security and Disaster Recovery protocols. If required, Evercam can use the Local Recordings stored on the physical hard drive to repopulate the Cloud recordings that are accessible to the Client on the Evercam platform.\n\nLocal Recordings, which are stored on physical hard drives, will be secured in the nearest Evercam regional HQ. The hard drive will be stored in secured areas where necessary steps are taken to protect them against fire, theft and any other physical damage. The hard drives themselves are also encrypted.\n\nRetention and Destruction Requests\n\nTo initiate the process of data deletion, the client can send a request to our support team at support@evercam.io. Our team will verify the request with the nominated Client contact and take the necessary steps to securely delete the data from our servers and physical media. A Certificate of Deletion or Retention can be provided upon request, as the case may be.\n\nData Destruction Procedures\n\nOnce the data retention period has expired, or if the client requests deletion of their data, Evercam ensures complete and secure removal of the data. This involves deleting the data from the servers and wiping the hard drives of any physical media to prevent any unauthorised access or recovery of the data. We take every precaution to ensure that the data is completely and irreversibly erased, in accordance with industry best practices and data privacy regulations.\n\nData can be sent to the customer on request (physical HDD or uploaded). Charges will apply and will be quoted at time of client request.\n\nCreated by: Compliance Manager (ISMS team)\n\nCreation date: 17.02.2023\n\nLast modification date: 18.02.2025\n\nDocument approver: Head of Compliance"

    "title": "Data Handling & Retention Guidelines",
    "url": "https://user.evercam.io/doc/data-handling-retention-guidelines-y7MkyTyjsC",
    "text": "Purpose\n\nWe have set out how our organisation classifies the information we process, and how users should handle that information, in section 1 of our Information Security Policy. The Information Security Policy is the primary policy we use to communicate our requirements for the secure use of devices, workspaces, and information to all users of our information systems and assets. However, when data is first collected or created, it may not be immediately clear how the data should be classified, or who the owner of the data may be. This may result in information being inadvertently shared, or even deleted where it should be retained, which is of particular concern when processing personal data.\n\nTo minimise the risk of inappropriate collection or sharing, accidental loss or destruction, or unauthorised access in these types of scenarios, our organisation has set out best practice principles to help guide our users in the protection of information throughout its lifecycle.\n\nScope\n\nThis document applies to all information that we process as part of our work-related activities. Where there is overlap between the data classification and handling requirements set out in the Information Security Policy and this document, the Information Security Policy shall take precedence.\n\nAudience\n\nAll employees, contractors, and other relevant third-parties shall understand and follow this document when determining how data should be collected, handled, and retained. For the purposes of this document, instructions directed at employees shall also apply to contractors, and other relevant third-parties, and shall be collectively referred to as \"users\". Where discussing the classification and handling of information, users with overall responsibility for the data shall be referred to as the \"data owner\".\n\nCommunication\n\nThese Data Handling & Retention Guidelines shall be communicated to all employees and agency staff as part of our employee induction programme, and periodically following any changes to the available guidance and compliance requirements. All contractors and other relevant third-parties shall be provided with a copy of this document as part of the process for contracting services, and shall be re-issued with updated versions periodically following any changes to the guidelines.\n\nDisciplinary Process\n\nIt is understood that this document and the guidance set out in it may not cover every scenario that arises, or be applicable to every type of data that we handle. However, employees, contractors, or other relevant third-parties performing activities which clearly disregard the guidelines set out in this document shall be subject to the disciplinary process documented in the Company Manual, or the applicable service contract.\n\nImprovement\n\nManagement are committed to the continual improvement of our Data Handling & Retention Guidelines, and shall review this document on an annual basis, or whenever an independent review reveals a change in legal and/or regulatory requirements. The Management Review shall determine if this policy continues to meet the requirements of our organisation.\n\n\n\nManagement also endeavours to plan our business operations so that our information is not misused, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is done by identifying and assigning separate duties throughout our critical business activities to guard against misuses such as illegal transfers, or other errors in data processing activities, etc. Where a user identifies potential conflicts or misuse of information due to improper planning and assignment of duties, users should raise their concern immediately with their line manager, or the ISMS Manager.\n\n1. Data Handling Principles\n\nTo ensure that the data we process is handled and protected appropriately, it is important for all users and data owners to know and understand best practice principles for data processing. Our organisation uses the data privacy principles set out in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as the core principles for the handling of all information we process, regardless of data type or classification. This section sets out these core principles, and how our organisation expects users and data owners to adhere to them in their day-to-day activities.\n\n1.1 Limit Use of the Data\n\nThis principle is frequently referred to as \"purpose limitation\". Information is usually collected for a purpose, and understanding that purpose will assist in identifying the correct controls for handling and retaining it, such as who should have access to it, where it should be stored, how long it should be kept for, etc. Where information is taken and used for a different purpose than what it was collected for, users could expose the data to risks such as unauthorised access, misuse, or non-compliance with legal or regulatory considerations.\n\nFor personal data, the data can only be used for a different purpose when permitted by law. For example, where customer contact data has been collected for the purpose of providing product support, it would not be compatible or lawful for that contact data to be used in a digital marketing campaign unless the customer provided their explicit consent to do so.\n\nUsers and data owners should always consult with the ISMS Manager and/or Data Protection Lead when considering using data for a purpose other than what it was originally collected for.\n\n1.2 Have a Genuine Reason\n\nProcessing information when there is no defined business case for it can expose our organisation to unnecessary data breaches, or legal and regulatory penalties. Where information is collected simply because it seems like it may be useful at the time, it may result in a lack of defined controls or ownership of the data, and an increased level of risk due to inappropriate storage and/or protection.\n\nFor personal data, processing without an appropriate legal basis is unlawful. For example, an employer would have no legal basis for sharing employee data with a private research organisation studying workforce demographics, even though the data would be legitimately interesting to the private research organisation, and the employer may receive payment for sharing the data. This is because employees would likely have no knowledge of the private research organisation's activities, and the employer would have no lawful reason to share the employee data for the purposes of private research. The employees' information could only be processed lawfully by the private research organisation where the organisation has received explicit consent directly from the employees, or where the employer sufficiently anonymises the data so that it is no longer considered personal data.\n\nThe GDPR currently sets out the following legal bases for the processing of personal data:\n\nConsent\n\nPerformance of a contract\n\nLegal obligation\n\nProtection of vital interests\n\nPublic interest/exercise of official authority\n\nLegitimate interest\n\nIn addition to the above, there are situations in which lawful processing may take place on the following bases:\n\nFurther processing\n\nLaw enforcement purposes\n\nWhen initiating and developing projects that involve the collection of information, data owners should always consult with the ISMS Manager and/or Data Protection Lead to ensure there is a valid legal basis or business case for processing the information.\n\n1.3 Use Data Fairly\n\nEven where information has been collected and processed for a genuine reason, the processing activity may produce unfair results, or unfairly or negatively impact individuals. This could expose our organisation to potential reputation damage, or loss of trust, and being legally correct in this instance may not be beneficial.\n\nData owners should always consider the needs and expectations of all interested parties when considering how to use information. In particular, when working on projects that involve the collection and processing of personal data, data owners shall always ensure that:\n\nAny impacts on the rights and freedoms of individuals are fully assessed and justifiable, and that the results of assessments are confirmed with the Data Protection Lead.\n\nThe information provided to individuals is not misleading, possibly resulting in them being surprised or confused about the processing activity.\n\n1.4 Be Open & Honest\n\nUnless required to maintain strict confidentiality for certain information processing activities, transparency about why and how we use information creates trust and confidence in our colleagues, customers, business partners, employees, suppliers, and other interested parties. A data owner or user who is not open and honest about what data they are collecting and how they are using it may expose the organisation to unnecessary data breach, legal and regulatory penalties, or even cause harm to individuals. Whether being honest about the applications used, where data is stored, or who it is shared with, data owners and users should ensure they clearly communicate this information to line managers and/or relevant team members so that the data can be appropriately handled and protected.\n\nFor personal data, individuals have the legal right to be informed about the use of their personal data. Data owners shall consult with the Data Protection Lead to ensure that information about the use of personal data is clearly and appropriately communicated to individuals in line with applicable data protection law.\n\n1.5 Only Use What's Necessary\n\nThis principle is known as \"data minimisation\", and supports the principle of data protection by design and by default. Where we don't absolutely need the data to carry out a required task or meet a business objective, then we shouldn't collect it, as limiting what we process automatically minimises our organisation's exposure to data breach, misuse of data, and legal and regulatory penalties. Quite simply, if we don't have it, then we can't lose or expose it.\n\nFor personal data, our organisation is legally obligated to collect only what is absolutely necessary to achieve the objective of the processing activity. For example, where a web-service provider needs only a verified email address and username to authorise a user's access to their application, it would be unnecessary to ask a user for information about their gender, location, address, or age for the purposes of authenticating their account. The additional identity data would not only be irrelevant, with no genuine reason to collect and retain it, but in the event of a data breach, a malicious attacker would have a lot more information about users. This information could then allow a malicious attacker to more effectively target a user for scams, fraud, or possible identity theft.\n\nWhen initiating and developing projects that involve the collection and processing of data, data owners should ensure they only collect and use what they need.\n\n1.6 Keep Data Accurate\n\nWhether using data for research and analysis, or maintaining customer or employee records, data that is inaccurate or out of date can negatively impact business decisions and operational activities, as well as our employees, customers, suppliers, and other interested parties. In the case of personal data, individuals have a legal right to expect their personal information to be kept accurate and available. This means that data owners should identify and document appropriate procedures for maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the information used, and ensure they are clearly communicated to users who may work with the data. Users should ensure they adhere to the procedures, and appropriately maintain the accuracy of the information they work with.\n\n1.7 Don't Store Data Longer Than Necessary\n\nFrom having to convert data into formats suitable for archiving, to maintaining legacy equipment to be able to retrieve the information, storing data for long periods of time can not only introduce business costs and operational difficulties, but where data is kept for longer than necessary, it also exposes our organisation to increased risk of data breaches, and legal and regulatory penalties. For personal data, our organisation is legally obligated to securely dispose of the data once it has fulfilled its purpose.\n\nUsing the legal, regulatory, and contractual considerations identified in section 1 of the Information Security Policy and our Critical Asset Register, data owners shall identify appropriate retention periods for the data we process, record these periods to section 2 of this document for reference, and ensure appropriate procedures are implemented to delete information when retention periods are met. Where necessary, data owners should also document and communicate data removal procedures to users who may work with the data to ensure continuous compliance with retention requirements.\n\n1.8 Keep Data Safe & Secure\n\nRegardless of whether the information we collect or create has been classified or assigned a data owner, ensuring that it is protected by default will minimise the risk of unauthorised and potentially illegal access, loss, corruption, reproduction, illegal transfer, or destruction. As mentioned earlier in these guidelines, our Information Security Policy is the primary policy we use to communicate our requirements for the secure use of devices, workspaces, and information to all users of our information systems and assets. Data owners and users shall adhere to our Information Security Policy, and treat all information as confidential unless specifically labelled otherwise. This will ensure there is always a minimum level of protection applied to the information we process.\n\n1.8.1 Technically masking data\n\nIn addition to the requirements for proper handling and use of information and information assets as set out in our Information Security Policy, our organisation may be obligated to comply with contractual, legal, or regulatory requirements to technically restrict access to data by using approved techniques to mask it. It may also be necessary to mask data due to the level of risk associated with the inappropriate use or access of the information. Some technical mechanisms that can be used to mask data may include, but are not limited to:\n\nEncryption - using an approved encryption standard to encrypt the data. Only persons with permission to access the decryption key can decrypt and view the information.\n\nSubstitution - using a lookup file to substitute existing information with information that looks similar, but isn't accurate. For example, a credit card number may be substituted with a set of numbers that are in the same format as the credit card number, but are not the actual number of the credit card.\n\nShuffling - moving data around within the same data field so that the original data isn't immediately identifiable. For example, shuffling the numbers of a credit card number into a different order.\n\nMasking out - making parts of the information unreadable based on the level of access required. For example, payment systems may mask out all but the last four digits of credit card numbers visible to individuals managing customer accounts, while the system can still access the entire number in order to process payments.\n\nPseudonymisation - similar to substitution, this is usually used in the context of personal data, and involves replacing some information about a person with pseudonyms or randomised data so that the person can't be directly identified.\n\nAnonymisation - removing all identifiable information about an individual so that none of the data can be recombined to either directly or indirectly identify them. Where personal data has been completely anonymised, it would no longer be considered personally identifiable information, and may no longer require data masking.\n\nData owners shall use the legal and regulatory considerations identified in section 1 of the Information Security Policy and the Critical Asset Register to identify any requirements to mask data, and work with administrators to ensure appropriate masking techniques are identified and implemented, taking into consideration the policies for access control, network protection, and cryptographic controls set out in the Information Systems Security Policy.\n\n1.8.2 Preventing data leakage\n\nEven where data owners and users adhere to the requirements set out in our Information Security Policy, the daily use, copying, sharing, and transmission of data may result in unintended loss, leakage, or even malicious exfiltration. Where working with sensitive information, it may be necessary to implement additional technical mechanisms to prevent unintended copying and sharing of information. Some technical mechanisms may include, but are not limited to:\n\nTechnically preventing the copying and pasting of sensitive information in databases and other information systems.\n\nImplementation of network controls such as jump servers, which control and track connections to information systems storing sensitive information.\n\nEmail data loss prevention (DLP) systems which track and quarantine emails containing sensitive information. Emails containing sensitive information would be held in quarantine until approved for release, where appropriate.\n\nEndpoint DLP software which monitors the use and storage of information on user devices and other information assets. The software may technically prevent use of removable media, or the moving and saving of data to unapproved locations.\n\nNetwork DLP solutions which monitor sensitive information being transmitted across a network.\n\nCloud DLP solutions which monitor and encrypt sensitive information stored and transferred using cloud-based services. These solutions may be configured to block the use of unapproved services, or upload of unencrypted data.\n\nData owners shall determine the risks associated with the loss of the sensitive information, and work with administrators to ensure suitable mechanisms for preventing data leakage are identified and implemented, where appropriate.\n\n1.9 Keep Track of Data\n\nNecessary security controls and retention procedures cannot be applied to data that is not appropriately identified and tracked. For personal data, this is referred to as the principle of \"accountability\", and depending on the size of the organisation and nature of the processing activities, may require the creation and maintenance of records of processing. Failure to keep track of the information we handle may expose our organisation to increased risk of data breaches, and legal and regulatory penalties.\n\nOur organisation keeps track of the information that we handle by identifying, recording, and managing our information assets in line with our ISO 27001-aligned information security management system (ISMS), as documented in our ISMS Manual. The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to these information assets are recorded to our Critical Asset Register, and also used to maintain the legal and regulatory considerations documented in section 1 of our Information Security Policy. Data owners shall ensure the necessary retention periods set out in these legal and regulatory requirements are identified and recorded to section 2 of this document.\n\nWhere changes to existing information assets occur, or where new information assets are identified, data owners shall review and update the below section, as appropriate.\n\n2. Data Retention Requirements\n\nAs mentioned in section 1.7 above, data that we collect and use must only be retained as long as necessary. Data retention requirements may be set out in laws and regulations, determined by our customers in contracts, or even set by data owners based on our organisation's own business requirements.\n\nData owners shall use the applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and other considerations identified in our Critical Asset Register, and section 1 of our Information Security Policy, to identify expected retention periods for the information we process, and document these in the table below.\n\nData Type\n\nRetention Period\n\nGuidance\n\nAssociated Critical Asset\n\nData Owner\n\nCompany VAT records\n\nIndefinite\n\nwww.revenue.ie - IE\n\nHMRC - UK\n\nIRS - US\n\nIRAS - SG\n\nATO - AU\n\nGoogle Drive\n\nGovernmental websites\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nCRO filings\n\nwww.cro.ie\n\nCustomer Data\n\nTerms of Service;\n\nData Processing Agreement\n\nTerms of Service; GDPR;\n\nApplication production environment\n\nHetzner, AWS, CRM\n\nChief Technology Officer and Chief Operations Officer\n\nEmployee personal information (name, address, date of birth etc.)\n\n7 years\n\nGDPR; Local employment laws and regulations; Workplace Relations Commission\n\nZoho People; Google Drive\n\nChief People Officer\n\nPayroll details and Payslips\n\nRevenue, GDPR; Local tax laws and regulations; Workplace Relations Commission\n\nXero, Gusto, SimplePay, Google Drive\n\nNative Teams\n\nEmployee working time information and absences (maternity/paternity, sickness, extended leave)\n\nZoho People, Xero, Revenue online system\n\nCareer progression (roles held, promotions, quarterly reviews, trainings, etc.)\n\nZoho People, Google Drive\n\nWritten Terms of Employment (documentation relating to employment or offers of employment)\n\nZoho People, Zoho Sign, Google Drive\n\nESOP\n\nShares Agreement, ESOP Manual\n\nZoho Sign, Google Drive, Global Shares portal\n\nChief People Officer and Chief Financial Officer\n\nRecruitment application forms and interview notes for unsuccessful candidates\n\n1 year\n\nZoho Recruit\n\nSupport Tickets\n\n3 years\n\nBusiness requirements of the Sales and Operations teams\n\nZoho Desk\n\nDirector of Support\n\nLeads and prospect information\n\nTerms of Service; Data Processing Agreement\n\nFor as long as the data remains relevant or until the individual requests their data to be deleted (subject to consent and privacy laws)\n\nZoho CRM\n\nChief Revenue Officer\n\nCorporate website analytics data\n\nRetain for a reasonable period to analyse marketing effectiveness and trends.\n\nGDPR; Business requirements of the sales and marketing teams.\n\nCorporate website; Zoho analytics\n\nChief Revenue Officer and Head of Marketing\n\nCCTV footage from cameras at local offices.\n\nGDPR; HR Manual\n\nCCTV systems at the local offices\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nCreated by: Compliance Manager (ISMS)\n\nCreation date: 24.05.2023\n\nLast modification date:\n\n01.01.2025\n\nDocument approver: Head of Compliance"

It takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.\n\nAt Evercam, we have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery, and we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships. We also implement and enforce effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.\n\nWe are also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our approach to tackling modern slavery throughout our supply chains, consistent with our disclosure obligations under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.\n\nThis policy applies to all persons working for us or on our behalf in any capacity, including employees at all levels, directors, officers, agency workers, seconded workers, volunteers, interns, agents, contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives and business partners.\n\nPolicies\n\nEvercam is committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our business or our supply chains.

We seek to work only with suppliers who demonstrate their compliance with relevant laws and regulations regarding modern slavery.\n\nLegal right to work\n\n- Evercam is aware of our legal obligation to check the right to work of all employees before hiring them. This requirement is essential to prevent illegal employment, protect the rights of individuals, and ensure compliance with immigration laws. By conducting thorough checks, Evercam verifies that prospective employees have the necessary authorisation to work in a given country, thereby promoting a lawful and responsible workforce. The verification process typically involves examining original documents and confirming their authenticity with relevant authorities, ensuring a compliant and ethical approach to hiring.\n\nThe above applies to any labour agencies that we might wish to use as well as lower tier subcontractors and their labour agencies. The verification process typically involves checking whether our suppliers have in place policies and procedures to reduce the possibility of people being subject to modern slavery or exploitation.\n\nFinal statement\n\nThis Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement will be regularly reviewed and updated as necessary. The Senior Management Team endorses this policy statement and is fully committed to its implementation.\n\nCreated by: Compliance Manager (ISMS team)\n\nCreation date: 27.08.2021\n\nLast modification date: 21.11.2024\n\nDocument approver: Chief People Officer"

Comments, suggestions and queries should be addressed to the compliance officer.\n\nWhat is Tax Evasion Facilitation?\n\nFor the purposes of this policy:\n\nTax evasion means the offence of cheating the public revenue or fraudulently evading tax, and is a criminal offence. The offence requires an element of fraud, which means there must be deliberate action, or omission with dishonest intent;\n\nForeign tax evasion means evading tax in a foreign country, provided that conduct is an offence in that country and would be a criminal offence if committed. As with tax evasion, the element of fraud means there must be deliberate action, or omission with dishonest intent; and\n\nTax evasion facilitation means being knowingly concerned in, or taking steps with a view to, the fraudulent evasion of tax (whether UK tax or tax in a foreign\n\n(country) by another person, or aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of that offence. Tax evasion facilitation is a criminal offence, where it is done deliberately and dishonestly.\n\nUnder the Criminal Finances Act 2017, a separate criminal offence is automatically committed by a corporate entity or partnership where the tax evasion is facilitated by a person acting in the capacity of an “associated person” to that body. For the offence to be made out, the associated person must deliberately and dishonestly take action to facilitate the tax evasion by the taxpayer. If the associated person accidentally, ignorantly, or negligently facilitates the tax evasion, then the corporate offence will not have been committed. The company does not have to have deliberately or dishonestly facilitated the tax evasion itself; the fact that the associated person has done so creates the liability for the company.\n\nTax evasion is not the same as tax avoidance or tax planning. Tax evasion involves deliberate and dishonest conduct. Tax avoidance is not illegal and involves taking steps, within the law, to minimise tax payable (or maximise tax reliefs).\n\nIn this policy, all references to tax include national insurance contributions and their equivalent in local jurisdictions.\n\nWhat You Must Not Do\n\nIt is not acceptable for you (or someone on your behalf) to:\n\nengage in any form of facilitating tax evasion or foreign tax evasion;\n\naid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of a tax evasion offence or foreign tax evasion offence by another person;\n\nfail to promptly report any request or demand from any third party to facilitate the fraudulent evasion of tax, or any suspected fraudulent evasion of tax by another person, in accordance with this policy;\n\nengage in any other activity that might lead to a breach of this policy; or\n\nthreaten or retaliate against another individual who has refused to commit a tax evasion offence or a foreign tax evasion offence or who has raised concerns under this policy.\n\nYour Responsibilities\n\nYou must ensure that you read, understand and comply with this policy. The prevention, detection and reporting of tax evasion and foreign tax evasion are the responsibility of all those working for us or under our control. You are required to avoid any activity that might lead to, or suggest, a breach of this policy.\n\nYou must notify your line manager and/or the compliance officer as soon as possible if you believe or suspect that a conflict with this policy has occurred, or may occur in the future. For example, if an employee or supplier asks to be paid into an offshore bank account, without good reason, or a supplier asks to be paid in cash, indicating that this will mean the payment is not subject to VAT. Further “red flags” that may indicate potential tax evasion or foreign tax evasion are set out in clause 12.\n\nHow to Raise a Concern\n\nYou are encouraged to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion of tax evasion or foreign tax evasion at the earliest possible stage.\n\nIf you become aware of any fraudulent evasion of tax (whether UK tax or tax in a foreign country) by another person in the course of your work, or you are asked to assist another person in their fraudulent evasion of tax (whether directly or indirectly), or if you believe or suspect that any fraudulent evasion of tax has occurred or may occur, whether in respect to UK tax or tax in a foreign country, you must notify your line manager and/or the compliance officer as soon as possible.\n\nIf you are unsure about whether a particular act constitutes tax evasion or foreign tax evasion, raise it with your line manager and/or the compliance officer as soon as possible. You should note that the corporate offence is only committed where you deliberately and dishonestly take action to facilitate tax evasion or foreign tax evasion. If you do not take any such action, then the offence will not be made out. However, a deliberate failure to report suspected tax evasion or foreign tax evasion, or “turning a blind eye” to suspicious activity could amount to criminal facilitation of tax evasion.\n\nProtection\n\nIndividuals who raise concerns or report another’s wrongdoing, are sometimes worried about possible repercussions. We aim to encourage openness and will support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken.\n\nWe are committed to ensuring no one suffers any detrimental treatment as a result of:\n\nrefusing to take part in, be concerned in, or facilitate tax evasion or foreign tax evasion by another person;\n\nrefusing to aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of a tax evasion offence or a foreign tax evasion offence by another person; or\n\nreporting in good faith their suspicion that an actual or potential tax evasion offence or foreign tax evasion offence has taken place, or may take place in the future.\n\nDetrimental treatment includes dismissal, disciplinary action, threats or other unfavourable treatment connected with raising a concern. If you believe that you have suffered any such treatment, you should inform the compliance officer immediately. If the matter is not remedied, and you are an employee, you should raise it formally using our Grievance Procedure.\n\nTraining and Communication\n\nTraining on this policy forms part of the induction process for all individuals who work for us, and regular training will be provided as necessary. Such training may form part of wider financial crime detection and prevention training.\n\nOur zero-tolerance approach to tax evasion and foreign tax evasion must be communicated to all suppliers, contractors and business partners at the outset of our business relationship with them and as appropriate after that.\n\nBreaches of this Policy\n\nAny employee who breaches this policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal for misconduct or gross misconduct.\n\nWe may terminate our relationship with other individuals and organisations working on our behalf if they breach this policy.\n\nPotential Risk Scenarios: “Red Flags”\n\nThe following is a list of possible red flags that may arise during the course of you working for us and which may raise concerns related to tax evasion or foreign tax evasion. The list is not intended to be exhaustive and is for illustrative purposes only.\n\nIf you encounter any of these red flags while working for us, you must report them promptly to your line manager and/or the compliance officer:\n\nyou become aware, in the course of your work, that a third party has made or intends to make a false statement relating to tax, has failed to disclose income or gains to, or to register with, HMRC (or the equivalent authority in any relevant non-UK jurisdiction), has delivered or intends to deliver a false document relating to tax, or has set up or intends to set up a structure to try to hide income, gains or assets from a tax authority;\n\nyou become aware, in the course of your work, that a third party has deliberately failed to register for VAT (or the equivalent tax in any relevant non-UK jurisdiction) or failed to account for VAT;\n\na third party requests payment in cash and/or refuses to sign a formal commission or fee agreement, or to provide an invoice or receipt for a payment made;\n\nyou become aware, in the course of your work, that a third party working for us as an employee asks to be treated as a self-employed contractor, but without any material changes to their working conditions;\n\na supplier or other subcontractor is paid gross when they should have been paid net, under a scheme such as the Construction Industry Scheme;\n\na third party requests that payment is made to a country or geographic location different from where the third party resides or conducts business;\n\na third party to whom we have provided services requests that their invoice is addressed to a different entity, where we did not provide services to such entity directly;\n\na third party to whom we have provided services asks us to change the description of services rendered on an invoice in a way that seems designed to obscure the nature of the services provided;\n\nyou receive an invoice from a third party that appears to be non-standard or customised;\n\na third party insists on the use of side letters or refuses to put terms agreed in writing or asks for contracts or other documentation to be backdated;\n\nyou notice that we have been invoiced for a commission or fee payment that appears too large or too small, given the service stated to have been provided;\n\na third party requests or requires the use of an agent, intermediary, consultant, distributor or supplier that is not typically used by or known to us;\n\nCreated by: Compliance Manager (ISMS team)\n\nCreation date: 27.08.2021\n\nLast modification date: 21.11.2024\n\nDocument approver: Chief Financial Officer"

    "text": "Policy statement\n\nEvercam (including its companies globally, together with the “Company”) is committed to complying with all laws and regulations which govern our operations in every country in which we operate. This Anti-Bribery Policy (the “Policy”) explains our individual responsibility to comply with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws around the world and to ensure that any third parties that we engage to act on our behalf, do the same. The penalties for violating these laws can be severe, both for the Company and for the individuals involved, including significant corporate and individual fines, and imprisonment. Evercam has a zero-tolerance attitude towards bribery. Even the suggestion of corruption may damage the reputation of the Company and affect its ability to do business, as well as the reputation of its employees. The Company is therefore committed to doing business ethically, even if this means not gaining new business, not using the services of particular agents or business partners or incurring delays in carrying on our existing business. Any violation of this Policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal in appropriate circumstances. It is therefore extremely important that you familiarise yourself with this Policy and strictly adhere to it. If you have any questions, please consult your Designated Legal/Compliance Officer.\n\nScope\n\nThe principles and obligations outlined in this Policy apply to all employees of Evercam companies globally, members of Evercam’s Board of Directors, and Evercam’s contractors (which include agents, consultants, outsourced personnel and other representatives). As such, each of us is responsible for adhering to these standards in our business interactions, and we must ensure that all Company contractors retained by us understand that they are responsible for complying with this Policy when acting on behalf of the Company. This Policy sets forth Evercam minimum compliance standards with respect to interactions with third parties. However, where local law, regulations or local or Business Unit internal policies require more stringent controls, then such more stringent controls must be followed. It is the responsibility of each local market/ Business Unit to identify and strictly adhere to all more stringent local/ Business Unit requirements and controls.\n\nWhat is a Bribe?\n\nA bribe means:\n\nThe offering, promising, giving, authorising, requesting or receiving of financial or non-financial advantage or anything of value.\n\nIf the purpose of the payment is to secure the improper performance of/ misuse of a person’s position.\n\nProhibition of Bribery\n\nNo person who is subject to this Policy shall:\n\nOffer, provide, or authorise, a bribe or anything which may be viewed as a bribe either directly or indirectly or otherwise through any third party; or\n\nRequest or receive a bribe or anything which may be viewed as a bribe either directly or indirectly or otherwise through any third party, or perform their job functions improperly in anticipation, or in consequence, of a bribe.\n\nThe prohibition on accepting a bribe from, or giving a bribe to, any person applies to any person acting in the course of a business, as an employee of a business or otherwise on behalf of others in relation to their performance of their duties and to public officials. Any dealings with public officials present a particularly high risk. Another high-risk group for contact with Evercam employees and contractors is healthcare professionals (such as doctors, nurses, nutritionists, etc.) specifically those who work in a public setting such as State medical services, hospitals, and other nationalised industries. Even the appearance of improper conduct in the context of public officials would have a significant reputational impact on Evercam’s public image. Evercam employees and contractors must take great care in these situations. Under this Policy, public officials include any officer, employee or representative of the government or a government-owned entity. The term will also extend to a legislative, administrative or judicial official, regardless of whether elected or appointed; an officer of, or an individual who holds a position in, a political party; a candidate for political office; or the person who otherwise exercises a public function for or on behalf of any country. This list is not exhaustive so you should consult with your Designated Legal/Compliance Officer if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nFacilitation Payment\n\nFacilitation payments are small unofficial payments to public officials to ensure or speed up the performance of routine or necessary action which is part of the public official’s usual responsibilities. These are bribes, regardless of whether they may be a part of the “way of doing business” in a particular country. As a representative of the Company, you must not make any facilitation payments unless you or your companions are at personal physical risk if you fail to do so.\n\nThird Parties\n\nEvercam could be held responsible for the actions of a third party (e.g. distributor, agent, contractor, supplier, joint venture partner) acting on its behalf. As such, care must be taken to ensure that those third parties do not engage or attempt to engage in bribery. All group companies shall:\n\nEnsure that any new third parties (or third parties whose contracts are being renewed) who provide services on behalf of Evercam contractually agree to abide by the principles set out in our Code of Conduct and this Policy.\n\nUndertake sufficient due diligence in relation to any proposed acquisition or joint venture to ensure that bribery is unlikely. This may include a search of the database on anti-bribery and sanctions lists and checking for relationships with public officials.\n\nThe results of the due diligence process shall be appropriately documented. Undertake sufficient due diligence (including checking of responses) in relation to the new third party’s background, capability and reputation to ensure that bribery is unlikely, where any of the “red flags” (see list of Red Flags further below in this Policy) are met. This shall include a search of the database on anti-bribery and sanctions lists, checking for relationships with public officials and documenting the reasons for choosing a particular third party. The results, assessments, and reports of the due diligence process shall be documented and produced on request by the Business owner and Procurement. If the due diligence process raises concerns, you must contact the Legal or Compliance Department immediately.\n\nRepeat due diligence every year for ongoing third-party relationships or those which have not previously been checked but which meet the requirements above.\n\nGifts and Hospitality\n\nThe act of exchanging business gifts and receiving corporate hospitality can play an appropriate role in building or maintaining business relationships. However, gifts and hospitality are problematic if they create actual or perceived conflicts of interest, or otherwise appear to influence a business decision.\n\nAccepting gifts, discounts, favours, or services from a current or potential customer, competitor, supplier, or service provider is prohibited if that benefit is a type or amount which has the potential to influence a person’s business decision. Functions like procurement and sales or health care personnel must take extra care. More strict requirements might apply and these groups might not be allowed to take or give any gifts or hospitality under certain circumstances or policies and procedures applicable to that group. If you have any questions, please consult your Designated Legal/Compliance Officer.\n\nGifts are only permitted if they are:\n\nReasonable\n\nInfrequent\n\nIn good taste\n\nUnsolicited\n\nNot cash or a cash equivalent; and\n\nnot given with the intent to influence a business decision.\n\nOccasionally, for the purpose of building relationships, you may accept or offer social entertainment or hospitality, such as modest meals or event tickets. However, you must not accept or offer entertainment or hospitality unless the activity:\n\npermits business or educational discussions at the meal or event (a Company representative must be in attendance at the meal or event)\n\nis part of a genuine business relationship;\n\nis not intended and could not be perceived by others to improperly influence business decisions;\n\nis consistent with industry practices, all applicable laws, and our Company policies and procedures;\n\nis not excessive in value or quantity, as defined by local procedural documents; and\n\nwould not embarrass our Company if it was brought to public attention.\n\nWhere local law, regulations or standards, or local or divisional internal policies {e.g. IFCN policies} apply and require more stringent processes/ controls, then such more stringent processes/ controls must be followed.\n\nPolitical Donations\n\nAs stated in our Code of Conduct, the Company is not a political organisation. It does not support political parties or contribute funds to groups whose activities are calculated to promote party interests or the election of a specific candidate. In very limited instances, if permitted by local law and regulation and with specific approval from the General Manager, the Company may contribute funds toward organisations or entities that engage in the political process to address an issue that directly affects the Company and its business activity. Any request for approval for such payments and the permission must be documented in writing and the payments properly recorded.\n\nCharitable contributions\n\nCharitable contributions may only be given to recognized non-profit charitable organisations. All donations must be:\n\ntransparent and properly recorded in our books and records; and\n\nreceipted or have a letter of acknowledgement from the charity to ensure that the donations receive the proper tax treatment\n\nbe compliant with local law, regulations or local or Business Unit internal policies\n\nDonations must not:\n\nbe made to individuals or in cash, or\n\nbe made at the request of a public official as an inducement to or reward for acting improperly.\n\nRecord Keeping\n\nFinancial and non-financial records which Evercam maintains are disclosed to shareholders, regulators, and other stakeholders. Accordingly, these records must be accurate and complete so that the Company can substantiate and justify any transactions with third parties.\n\nAll persons who are subject to this Policy must declare and record in writing all hospitality and gifts given or received. Evercam introduced an electronic Gift and Entertainment Register whose disclosure form can be accessed on the intranet. All persons who are subject to this Policy with access to the intranet are expected to use it for recording. They must also submit expense claims relating to hospitality, gifts or payments made to third parties promptly and provide justification for this expenditure.\n\n“Red Flags”\n\nThere are a number of issues that should cause us to do some further investigation into whether a particular transaction or relationship may present a potential bribery risk or issue.\n\nAll persons who are subject to this Policy must remain vigilant and attempt to spot any of the scenarios listed below. If you should come across a potential issue of the kind listed below, you should (i) consider whether further investigation and due diligence of your counterparty are necessary; and/or (ii) escalate the matter to your manager and you are Designated Legal/Compliance Officer. Potential issues which call for further vigilance and/or investigation include:\n\nThe prevalence of bribery in a country that has a nexus with a particular transaction or relationship (the third party is located in such a country or the transaction involves such a country); e.g. according to the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) as evaluated annually by Transparency International.\n\nPayments of unusually high fees or commissions;\n\nRequests for cash payments or requests for unexpected payments related to government approvals;\n\nRequests for payments to different companies or through different countries;\n\nUndefined or unreported payments to third parties made on Evercam’s behalf;\n\nNo written agreements;\n\nUnusually close relationships with government officials;\n\nA refusal to certify compliance with this Policy; or\n\nPayments without a PO number, where applicable.\n\nCreated by: Compliance Manager (ISMS team)\n\nCreation date: 27.08.2021\n\nLast modification date: 13.01.2025\n\nDocument Approver: Chief Financial Officer"

All of the Media Hub data and other project data (e.g. Gate Report data, etc) is retained.\n\nWhat does it mean to ‘Export’ my project data?\n\nExporting your project data means you are downloading your data from the Evercam platform to store it yourself. This allows you to keep a copy of your project data independently. You may re-import it to Evercam at a later time, for a fee, if required.\n\nWhat is included when I export my data?\n\nThe export option gives you a comprehensive export of everything related to the project, meaning all of the high-resolution images, all of the full-frame-rate video, all of the Media Hub data and all of the other project data (e.g. Gate Report data, etc) and any other project details stored on the Evercam platform is included in the Export option.\n\nHow do I access my exported data?\n\nOnce you choose to export your data, Evercam will provide you with a secure download link and/or will post you a physical hard-drive. You will have 14 days to download your data from this link before it expires.\n\nCan I import my data back into Evercam after exporting it?\n\nYes, you can re-import your data into Evercam in the future for a fee. Once re-imported, you can choose to store the data using either the Full or Partial Archive options.\n\nIs there a cost to export my data?\n\nYes, there is a fee associated with exporting your data. Please refer to the\n\nfor detailed information on current costs.\n\nWhat happens to my data on Evercam after I export it?\n\nAfter you export your data, your project data will be deleted from the Evercam platform.\n\nWhat if I don’t download my data within the 14-day period?\n\nIf you do not download your data within the 14-day period, the download link will expire, and you will need to request a new export from Customer Success, which will incur an additional fee. Please make sure to download your data promptly to avoid additional charges.\n\nIs my exported data still secure?\n\nOnce exported, it is your responsibility to store your data securely. The data is no longer hosted on the Evercam platform, so you'll need to ensure proper backup and security measures on your own systems.\n\nStill got Questions?\n\nIf you need assistance with Project Archiving, please reach out to our Customer Support team. We're here to help you every step of the way."

    "text": "What is the process of self-installation? Is it difficult?\n\nThe self-installation process is quite simple. The camera kit arrives packaged with the camera already mounted and connected to the enclosure. Once the hardware has been unpackaged, the\n\nenclosure will need to be mounted to the structure (wall, beam, column, pole, etc). The enclosure arrives with magnets already attached for a steel beam/column installation. After the enclosure is mounted, connect the AC power cord to the outlet or extension cord (not provided). The camera and associated hardware are preconfigured and will boot up / connect to the Evercam platform upon powering. Contact Evercam support staff to finalise the camera field of view (FOV).\n\nWhat is the lead time?\n\nSelf-install Bullet:\n\nSelf-install 180:\n\nPro Install Solar:\n\nWhat is included in the Evercam system shipped to me?\n\nYou will receive a camera, a mount, an enclosure (router, hard drive, edge processor), and the necessary cabling. If you are using solar, solar components are included.\n\nIs the hardware weatherproof?\n\nExterior camera systems have enclosures that are designed to protect against elements. Dirt, rain, and dust may accumulate on the lens, which we'd recommend wiping off if it is obstructing the field of view.\n\nIs there a self-installation video tutorial to assist me?\n\nYes!

    "text": "Building Construction Authority (BCA) Singapore has provided guidelines for the use of 360 Capture as an alternative form of inspection in lieu of physical inspection.\n\nEquipment: 360 Camera\n\nUtilise a high-quality 360 camera compatible with Android and iOS devices.\n\nWe recommend using Insta360 cameras, which is a leading 360 camera brand in the market, as we have integrated the SDK for Insta360 into our Capture app in order to manage the camera from the app.\n\nEnsure the camera supports at least 6K resolution, is suitable for low-light conditions, and is equipped with dual 1-inch CMOS sensors.\n\nInsta360 X4 and OneRS 1-inch cameras support up to 8K resolution.\n\nBattery capacity must be able to support at least 60-90 minutes of continuous video capture.\n\nThe X4 has increased its battery capacity to 2290mAh, which allows for 135 minutes of recording time at 5.7K30fps.\n\nThe X4 was tested in a lab environment in Video Mode at 5.7K30fps. Run time at 8K30fps is 75 minutes.\n\nBut the recommended duration is up to 30 minutes at 5750 resolution and above. Longer videos may experience longer processing times.\n\nEmploy a camera featuring 6-axis stabilisation and a proprietary image stabilisation algorithm for smooth videos.\n\nThe Insta360 One RS 1-inch offers\n\nEquipment: 360 Capture Platform\n\nEnsure that the platform allows users to capture 360 capture using most 360 cameras.\n\nSupporting every camera on the market is an unrealistic expectation for any platform. However, we have integrated the Insta360 SDK into our app, allowing seamless management of Insta360 cameras directly. If you prefer to use a different camera, you can still use Evercam by manually handling tasks like copying and downloading footage. Evercam is designed to be as hardware-independent as possible, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of setups.\n\nThe platform must be able to capture by continuous capture, by spot captures or by mixed captures.\n\n• For large areas, continuous capture must be used.\n\n• For smaller areas such as a room or a toilet unit, spot capture is allowed. However the operator must ensure the spot capture is able to clearly capture all four sides of the room, the floor and ceiling.\n\n• Mixed capture refers to the utilisation of both types of capturing methods.\n\nYes, these are all possible with the Evercam platform. Quality of capture will depend on the camera, settings, the way the capture was done, as well as other variables.\n\nThe platform must be able to tie every photo and capture onto an uploaded building plan.\n\n\n\nEvercam 360 has the ability to overlay site plans provided by the customer to the mini map feature. This feature shows the path taken during the walk and all the points of capture during the walk. If no plan is provided, we feature the Google map.\n\nThe platform should allow for comments and additional photo evidence to be attached onto the 360 Capture.\n\nEvercam 360 has a tagging feature which allows users to leave comments. We also have an Edit feature that allows marking-up of images within the walk.\n\nOur Mobile Capture app allows users to take other photos or still images during the walk as well as voice notes that can be attached to the 360.\n\nExternal parties (e.g. BCA inspectors) must be able to access the 360 Capture.\n\nCustomers can give unlimited access to their project in the Evercam platform. Once a user has access to a project, they will also have access to the 360 viewer.\n\nFor the purpose of TOP/CSC inspection, BCA inspectors must be able to tag comments on the 360 Capture.\n\nAny user of the Evercam platform can use the tagging feature within 360 view.\n\nQPs must be able to attach evidence of compliance (e.g. photo, video etc) to show the rectification of BCA comments\n\nImages (and videos) can be downloaded from and uploaded to the Evercam platform.\n\nUsers must be able to generate a report on all the comments to facilitate proper documentation.\n\nYes, we can and we will build it."

    "text": "Why do I need 360?\n\n360 is good for visualizing interiors, as well as exterior spaces. It's a tool that can be used for walkthroughs, snag lists, and presentations.\n\nWhich camera can I use to capture 360 images?\n\nWe recommend using Insta360, as it is the only one we support for now.\n\nSupporting every camera on the market is an unrealistic expectation for any platform. However, we have integrated the Insta360 SDK into our app, allowing seamless management of Insta360 cameras directly. If you prefer to use a different camera, you can still use Evercam by manually handling tasks like copying and downloading footage. Evercam is designed to be as hardware-independent as possible, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of setups.\n\nWho does the capturing?\n\n360 captures will be done by the customer.\n\nHow many walkthroughs can I upload per month?\n\nYou can upload unlimited walkthroughs within a month.\n\nWhat are the other 360 platforms I can integrate with?\n\nWe can integrate with Matterport, OpenSpace, and HoloBuilder, if you are already using these providers.\n\nCan I use point cloud scans?\n\nAt the moment, we do not support LiDAR cameras and point cloud models.\n\nHow accurate is the measuring tool?\n\nMeasurements will be very accurate if a reference measurement like the door height can be provided along with the video/ images so we can scale the model properly. A horizontal measurement of more than 2m long would obtain best results with the measuring tool. We require a new measurement reference each time as the project progresses.\n\nWhat if I don’t have an Insta 360 camera?\n\nYou can purchase your own online, or we can send a subcontractor on-site to do the walkthrough, and Evercam will do the rest.\n\nWhat is the workflow for processing a 360 video?\n\nThe customer does the walkthrough with the Insta360 camera and then sends us the videos through any sharing platform link. Our 3D Team processes the videos for 1-3 days and then notify the client once they are available for viewing in the Dashboard.\n\nWhen tagging events in 360 view, will it be uploaded into Autodesk build or is there a report that can be emailed/generated?\n\nCurrently, the tags are only visible in the Dashboard and cannot be synced to other software. Reports generation is part of our roadmap.\n\nWhy is the requirement for video and not images?\n\nTo process a 360 model, we need photos captured every 0.5 seconds sequentially. We use video because splitting the video gives exactly what we need.\n\nWhat can be done if there are low light levels in the site that will make it difficult to capture good 360 videos?\n\nYou can use external light sources that can be attached to the camera or hardhat that will help illuminate the area as you go through the walk.\n\nExamples in the market:\n\nhttps://seesense.eu/products/lighting/vr-lightning/bushman-panoramic-halo-360-light/\n\nCan I capture a 60-90 minute worth of continuous video?\n\nYes, you may by using external batteries or batteries with bigger capacity. Please note that the longer the video, the larger the file size hence the longer the processing time."

The name of your camera is \"X4 **\" by default, where ** is the last six digits of the serial number on the box your X4 came in. The first time you connect to X4, you will need to confirm the connection on the touchscreen.\n\nAfter successfully connecting the camera, follow the on-screen instructions to activate your camera. The app will prompt you to update the firmware if a new version is available. Please follow the on-screen prompts to update X4's firmware.\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://onlinemanual.insta360.com/x4/en-us/camera/firstuse/activation\n\n\n\nRead the\n\nX4 Online Manual\n\nLink: https://res.insta360.com/static/70093bf5f9bb8eb319b3b60e054ffb91/X4_UserManual_EN.pdf\n\n,\n\nX3 Online Manual\n\nLink: https://onlinemanual.insta360.com/x3/en-us/camera/basicuse/body\n\nor\n\nOne RS Manual\n\nLink: https://onlinemanual.insta360.com/oners/en-us/camera/firstuse/introduction1?_gl=1*1njyij2*_ga*ODk0MzAxMzM4LjE3MDc4MTkxMTg.*_ga_7TV2BE92TS*MTcxMDgxMzYxNS4zLjEuMTcxMDgxMzgwMC4yOC4wLjA.\n\nfor more information.\n\nOur 360 product can be used together with our\n\nEvercam Capture App\n\nLink: https://self\n\n, which is available on the Google Play Store and the Apple Store.\n\nSet up the camera before the walk\n\nAfter activating your new 360 camera (See steps above) and you are ready to take your walk, ensure your battery is fully charged and your SD card is inserted.

Before opening the Capture app, ensure that the Insta360 app is\n\nnot open or running in the background.\n\nPlease Note\n\nWiFi, Bluetooth, and Location permissions are all mandatory for the app to scan and connect to cameras. If any of these permissions are declined, the app will not function properly.\n\nAll permissions requested by the app must be accepted for full functionality. There are no exceptions.\n\nThere is no need to manually connect to the camera’s Wi-Fi using the last 5 digits of the serial number as the password. The app will automatically retrieve the password via Bluetooth.\n\nBluetooth is not only necessary to obtain the camera’s Wi-Fi credentials, but it is also required for the following reasons: The camera's Wi-Fi will turn off every 5 to 10 minutes to save battery. Without Bluetooth, the app would be unable to detect it. However, the camera’s Bluetooth (which stays on under the name \"BLE\" or Bluetooth Low Energy) will always be active, allowing the app to locate the camera, connect to it, retrieve the Wi-Fi password, and ultimately connect via Wi-Fi — which is the desired outcome for most users. In short, Bluetooth is essential for the entire connection process. There is no need to turn it off in an attempt to bypass it.\n\nIf you are having problems with the app after declining permission, there are two ways of fixing it:\n\n1 - Open Settings, and give the permissions back.\n\n2 - Uninstall and uninstall the app, and accept all the permissions when asked. (Note: if you re-install the app and the connection fails, usually restarting the phone fixes this)\n\nSteps\n\nLog in with the same credentials that you used for the Evercam Dashboard.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/103e6b78-858c-4841-a782-568b64806b52/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084853Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=1b962f182c66f1411426187bee97aaaf650e888bca6a6f17c137eebd83345002&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nSelect the project you wish to create a 360 walk for.\n\nThe list of projects you have access to will be seen in the Capture app. Alternatively, you can create a New Project from the Left-side navigation panel.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/9ccab9f4-9550-47a7-b8ac-393862aa466c/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084853Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=fcf1619074cd4a9ae4eabbf5acf22b4af77e838ef12f5ba89402c8833bf0dc91&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nConnect the camera.\n\nMake sure you have enough storage in your SD card and enough battery on the camera and your phone.

You can add a new floor or select from previously created floors.\n\nWe recommend uploading a floor plan (jpg) of the area so the walk can be geolocated on the plan.

Click the ”\n\nStart\n\n” button then enter your starting point on the map. Start walking in a pre-determined path to avoid mistakes and to cover the entire area. Walk close to the side of the walls at a nice steady pace. Walk in a Grid pattern within the space.\n\nOnce the walk is complete, press “\n\nStop\n\n”. The walk will automatically download. Once the download is complete, you will see “\n\nWalkthrough recorded\n\n” on the app.\n\nDo not switch off the camera or put your phone to sleep during the download.

You will see a list of files on the project home screen. The upload button indicates that the file is still saved locally on the app and can either be uploaded to the Evercam Dashboard or deleted.

(See\n\nhttps://seesense.eu/products/lighting/vr-lightning/bushman-panoramic-halo-360-light/\n\nas an example.)\n\nAs much as possible, walk in a space that is free of persons or moving objects.\n\nWhat should I share with you?\n\nAfter you're done capturing the walk, each video will generate 2\n\n.insv\n\nfiles:\n\nLRV (Low-Resolution Video): is used to preview the video.\n\nVID: is the original 360 video with all the data.\n\nYou'll only need to share the VID file with us to create the 360\n\nOptional: Mention the name of each floor corresponding to the files.\n\nPlease send us the files via a sharing platform (Dropbox, WeTransfer, Google Drive, etc.) or use our Capture App to upload the videos directly to our Ingest system.\n\nPlease provide a reference measurement from the site so we can scale the 360 properly. An example would be a measurement of a door/ window/ pole/ anything fixed that is seen in the walk.\n\nOptional:\n\n\n\nYou can send us a PDF of the floor plan so we can overlay it on the mini-map.\n\nIf Using Insta 360 ONE RS\n\nConnect to a PC\n\nYou can download ONE RS files to your PC, then use the Insta360 Studio to edit and export.\n\nSteps:\n\nTurn on ONE RS.\n\nSwipe down to open the Shortcut menu.

For the format, we only use geolocated JPEGs.\n\nWe recommend these drones:\n\nMavic 3 Enterprise\n\nMavic Air 2\n\nLink: https://click.dji.com/AKVoyAgd2ywgjlcvR9ggBg?pm=link\n\nMavic Pro\n\nHow frequent should the flights be?\n\nThis depends on how often you want the images updated.\n\nWhat does the software cost cover?\n\nThe 3D reconstruction from drone images\n\nIntegration of the model in the dashboard in its direct environment (geography and surrounding buildings)\n\nUpdates of the model for each flight\n\nAccess to all the functionalities (measuring, tags, compare, timeline…)\n\nHow many flights can I upload per month?\n\nYou can upload one flight per week.\n\nDo I need a BIM Model for Drone?\n\nA BIM Model is not necessary to create a Drone model, but if the client wants to integrate the BIM for the compare feature, then the BIM Model should be shared.\n\nHow accurate is the measuring tool?\n\nOur measuring tool is 95% accurate. Drone works entirely detached, and no architectural drawings or BIM is needed for distances or area measuring to work.\n\nWhat if we are using another provider?\n\nSend us the model as a Textured Mesh Model (preferable to a point cloud model) and the format has to be\n\nobj/ las\n\n."

    "text": "What height gives the best results?\n\nThis depends on the site and height of the tallest structure on site:\n\nIf it is a building site with no cranes, it is better to use 50m to 60m.\n\nIf there is a crane at 50-60m, then go 20m above it (around 80m to 90m).\n\nNote: All photos need to be taken at the same height.\n\nIs there an angle required?\n\nTo improve the accuracy and quality of the model, we recommend using a 65° angle.\n\nHow many photos should be taken?\n\nThis depends on the site's area, if it's: Less than 30,000 m² ⇒ 100 to 250 photos. Between 30,000 m² and 60.000 m² ⇒ 250 to 400 photos. Between 60,000 m² and 100.000 m² ⇒ 400 to 600 photos. More than 100,000 m² ⇒ +600 photos.\n\nNote: All photos should be taken in one mapping (multiple mappings give bad results).\n\nWhat about Flight Planning?\n\nWe usually recommend an evenly spread-out flight path to get details in an equal pattern (like the image below).\n\nA single flight at a fixed height is highly recommended. Different heights will cause processing issues and the flight might have to be redone.\n\nIt is okay to have a higher density of images around important structures on site, as long as the height is close to the altitude of the remaining bits of the flight.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/c380bbdb-d53b-450e-8586-38bac4e92705/4e5d45f8-8fbb-446f-8353-92eafe4a80ec/image?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084848Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=e4cf8702bd0e2048c383932c3af46917ce64c5a89e8d0540683a3cbd6e39f5d8&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject"

If it's a building site with no cranes etc. then usually around 60m, if there is a crane at 50-60m go approximately 20m above it so 80-90m. Usually, pictures are taken at one height.\n\nRecommended photo spacing interval:\n\nSpacing is controlled using the drone path mapping software. Different providers have different settings.\n\nThe angle required for taking the pictures:\n\nFor large sites, you can take them from straight down. If it's a small structure, like a bridge, then set the angle at 65 degrees and fly along the perimeter facing into the center of the site.\n\nLighting\n\nFlights should preferably be done with good lighting as low light conditions affect the quality of the textures.\n\nHardware Requirements for Drone\n\nFor a smooth experience with our Drone, we recommend:\n\nAt least 8 GB RAM\n\nA dedicated GPU (not integrated with the CPU)\n\nA processor similar to an Intel i5 CPU\n\nThe browser has to be able to support Webgl. For this, we recommend using Google Chrome."

This approach initially loads only the necessary parts of the model, with other geometry parts loading dynamically as the user navigates.\n\nOur Forge-based BIM viewer automatically caches critical model parts in the user's browser after the initial full model load. As long as you do not clear your browser cache, the viewer can quickly retrieve and display the cached model data in subsequent loads.\n\nUse the toolbar at the bottom of the viewer to explore the model.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/1227f2d7-c0b8-4f4c-90bf-251abee7929b/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084843Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=dea28107571b5337bf5f2822ec1ec2491ea19ef8f625a85d999503083d5e704f&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nFor easier navigation, use the Navigation cube on the upper right-hand side of the viewer.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/f390bce1-5796-49e0-9401-176adb77e954/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084843Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=8cf1287844ee574bd29f8956937de22af989d6c5f980235d2a1ed413e7bdd934&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nView the layers, elements and properties or change the viewer settings on the pop-ups by toggling their buttons on the lower toolbar.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/1814df3e-f524-4f80-a0cb-187275013de7/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084843Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=0deb4ea011f525d082194f1e8c7eec4c95619ea1fa217c2110b2f07bc2f75ccb&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nYou can still view the\n\nLive View\n\nof the cameras by clicking on the camera markers.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/b6a06d7f-7007-4e79-928f-7b22cc988a4c/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084843Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=a5de46f69dc9f524b7c9c75ca8c14a04ac8935458f908c3767320679082934d5&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nWatch the video below to see a demo of the features: (\n\n*video has no sound\n\n)\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/cefb1d0e-2f4b-40ee-845b-0d28ac544b23/Forge%20features.mp4?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084843Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=c5ddb720149f464261066eac8cf9cc7628179f50ffe90c816380250849628eb8&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nTo learn more about Autodesk viewer, visit\n\nhttps://help.autodesk.com/view/ADSKVIEWER/ENU/\n\nor see below:\n\nLink: https://help.autodesk.com/view/ADSKVIEWER/ENU/ "

    "text": "Single Vehicle Entry/Exit\n\nTo ensure optimal Gate Report system performance, it is essential that\n\nonly one vehicle enters or exits the gate at a time\n\n. The system is designed to process and accurately identify individual vehicles. Multiple vehicles within the camera's field of view simultaneously may result in inaccurate or missed data points.\n\nThe client is responsible for maintaining traffic flow to ensure that the Gate Report system can capture clear images of each vehicle independently.\n\nFalse Positives\n\nThe system might mistakenly identify something other than a license plate as a license plate. This can happen if there's an advertisement, a person wearing a numbered shirt, or any other object that resembles a license plate within the camera's view. This can lead to missed vehicle entries or inaccurate data.\n\nIt's important to understand that we cannot guarantee 100% accurate results in all situations. Factors like multiple vehicles, obstructions, and objects that mimic license plates can impact the system's performance.\n\nClient-Provided Data\n\nTo accurately assess the Gate Report system's performance, Evercam requires clients to choose one of the following options:\n\nProvide Manual Logs:\n\nThe client will provide manual logs or manifests of all vehicles entering and exiting the site for the first two weeks after installation. This data will be used to verify the accuracy of the Gate Report system.\n\nReport Individual Errors:\n\nIf the client chooses not to provide manual logs, they will be solely responsible for identifying and reporting any missed vehicle events within the Gate Report system. Without a benchmark like manual logs, neither Evercam nor the client can independently verify the system’s overall accuracy. Therefore, Evercam will rely exclusively on client-reported incidents to assess system performance.\n\nCalibration Period\n\nA\n\n14-day\n\ninitial setup period is necessary for thorough system calibration and data refinement. During this time, client-provided data is crucial for identifying and correcting discrepancies.\n\nDuplicate Entries and Other Reporting Considerations\n\nOur ANPR system may generate duplicate license plate entries within the reports. This is often due to vehicles stopping or parking within the camera's view, causing multiple captures of the same license plate. Additionally, trucks with two license plates can sometimes lead to incorrect plate cropping and duplicate entries.\n\nIt's important to note that our system requires a\n\n48-hour verification period\n\nto ensure the accuracy of the data. During this time, our system will analyze the captured data to identify and correct errors.\n\nTo guarantee optimal system performance, we recommend a\n\n14-day initial setup\n\nperiod to allow for thorough system calibration and data refinement.\n\nWhile we strive for accuracy, it's essential to understand that these factors can influence the data produced by the ANPR system.\n\nPlease note:\n\nDuplicate entries and other reporting nuances should not be considered system errors but rather expected outcomes in certain conditions.\n\nVisible Plate\n\nVehicles without a license plate will not be logged. This includes vehicles with badly damaged, dirty, or non-visible license plates.\n\nObstructions\n\nObstructions (people, machinery, etc.) that interfere with the camera’s field of view may result in missed events.\n\nNon-Evercam Gates\n\nEntries/Exits through gates not covered by Evercam Gate Report will not be logged.\n\nThe out-of-service gate will not be used, as we will only be able to capture vehicles entering through the main Gate 1 and Gate 2. If vehicles begin to use the out-of-service gate, then we expect inaccurate results.\n\nPower Supply\n\nLoss of power to the Gate Report camera system will result in unlogged events.\n\nInstall Conditions\n\nIf the installation site conditions differ from the agreed-upon plan, including issues with the location or installation process, Evercam reserves the right to postpone installation. In this case, we will work with you to create a revised plan. A refund, minus site visit costs, will be issued.\n\nTraffic Flow Compliance\n\nOur ANPR camera system is designed to optimally capture license plate information when vehicles approach the gate in a straight line, perpendicular to the camera's view. Any significant deviation from this path, such as vehicles entering or exiting at an angle greater than 30 degrees, may result in missed license plate captures and inaccurate reporting. To ensure accurate data collection, it is essential to maintain a consistent traffic flow pattern as outlined in the Gate Plan.\n\nDeviations from the specified traffic flow can lead to reduced system performance and potential inaccuracies in the generated reports.\n\nWeather Conditions\n\nWeather (rain, snow, fog) can reduce image clarity and result in unlogged events.\n\nSpeed Conditions\n\nVehicles going over the specified speed in the Gate Report Specification plan can result in unlogged events (200km/h).\n\nContext Field of View\n\nThe context camera's primary and sole priority will be to capture the vehicle and only the vehicle while overlapping the field of view of the ANPR camera. It is not to be prioritised for any other purpose or product (time-lapse, BIM, site visibility, etc.) without first prioritising the Gate Report product."

Once the model has been aligned, we will notify you that the feature has been enabled.\n\nFor our team to be able to create a BIM Compare, the Camera must have LDC (Lens Distortion Correction) enabled by our Support team. This means we remove the fisheye effect of the camera to make it straight. This will affect the camera's Field of View (FOV) and must be considered before approving the final FOV.\n\nIf the camera moves from its original position, the BIM Model will no longer be correctly aligned. We will re-align it when we are notified of the misalignment.\n\nA realignment due to the movement of a camera from one location to another by the camera owner will incur an additional charge. We have included 1 realignment per month as part of the original cost. Any additional realignment will incur additional costs.\n\nBIM Compare cannot be done on a 180-degree camera FOV or on a Gate Report camera.\n\nFeatures\n\nIf you want to access the features, click on the\n\nBIM Compare\n\ntab at the top of the dashboard.\n\nIf you want to view a specific date, select the\n\nCamera View\n\non the side panel and use the calendar to choose the date and time.\n\nThen you can use the BIM calendar to choose the date of the 4D model to match the Camera View date. Alternatively, you can use the timeline at the bottom of the screen to view specific BIM Model milestone dates.\n\nThese milestones can be hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. The BIM calendar will show dates without milestones as light gray or disabled. Days or hours with milestones will be shown in bold text together with a blue dot.\n\nYou can also use the\n\nFirst\n\nand\n\nLast\n\nbuttons to navigate to the ends of the project schedule.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/26834813-9c57-4bab-a474-f3bc3023bfd0/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084836Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=c19d9b0667e71e9e6d25f96b544bf1cd7d70532f747a8e59a7a84dce4249fcb6&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nTo compare the BIM Model with the construction progress, click and drag the slider to the left or right.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/25a8801e-32ef-4f9e-b62b-e0c4c763aee7/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084836Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=9f6e0a24c37611550dc16e5b53be24c9b0ab379dd12aa02945c29d3e80b9366f&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nIf you want to view a specific model layer, you can select the layer (Architectural/ Structural/ MEP/ 4D) in the side panel.\n\nNote:\n\nAvailable layers are dependent on the BIM model given.\n\nIf you would like to see the live view behind the BIM Model, you can use the\n\nTransparency\n\ntool on the side panel.\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/c380bbdb-d53b-450e-8586-38bac4e92705/7f1e7922-6bdc-4c9f-8c11-59fa66cd7c27/image?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084836Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=7accc3b71c778dc000883ef92bf0351833142bdd8c9885fd60fd2baaf60a8a7c&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/cb87051a-3194-4708-9d8d-183e114c5fe0/2d5612a3-1ef6-426a-b31a-b3c3aa600b65/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084836Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=8bd22998baf29dd41cdb38e7621d4c51135564f7fc7dc4a1d184f5fa6ca41b9f&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nIf you would like to download or share the image, you can export the current view as a GIF.

We're actively working to improve its accuracy and usefulness.\n\nWhat’s new with Copilot (v3.0)?\n\nImage: https://outline-production-attachments.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/uploads/4bf1c2a7-c871-4f3d-bfe8-98b0e8433621/7ec2bafe-2d4a-427b-b1e9-6af67c5a0f54/image.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4EOUDTOVUICLPZ4P%2F20250315%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250315T084830Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=f501da04a461eb8e9d2496edc203a749887c48e33b62f6c71033f6925aa8f5b1&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-amz-checksum-mode=ENABLED&x-id=GetObject\n\nDedicated Copilot Interface\n\n: You can now access Copilot through the dedicated user interface in the left-hand toolbar labeled\n\n“Copilot”\n\n(located under the\n\n“Timeline”\n\nsection).\n\nCustom Prompts for Images/Video\n\n: Copilot now supports custom queries about specific images or video clips, allowing direct analysis of site activity based on footage. This expands its capabilities beyond querying pre-collected data from Evercam's database.\n\nEnhanced Feedback System\n\n: User feedback is integral to improving Copilot. You can now provide thumbs-up/down responses on answers, which helps refine future AI outputs\n\nCurrent Capabilities\n\nCopilot can assist in the following areas, though accuracy may vary as the tool is still evolving:\n\nSafety hazards and compliance\n\nProject progress tracking and milestone reporting\n\nEquipment and manpower productivity\n\nSite conditions monitoring\n\nCompliance with regulations and site-specific requirements\n\nAssistance with Evercam features like integrating Procore, creating time-lapses, and more\n\nPlease note that as Copilot is still in beta, some results may not always be perfect. We're actively working to improve its accuracy and capabilities, and user feedback is critical in this process.\n\nExpectations for Users\n\nAccuracy of AI-Generated Responses\n\nCopilot assists in analyzing data, but its insights should not replace human oversight. Responses are a\n\nstarting point for decision-making\n\nand should be validated manually. For example, always cross-check a Copilot-generated safety report with on-site observations or official safety guidelines.\n\nOngoing Feedback and Improvement\n\nUser feedback directly impacts Copilot's performance. Each time you ask a question or rate a response, the system learns and improves. Use the thumbs-up or thumbs-down buttons at the bottom of each response to indicate accuracy or relevance.\n\nHow to Use the Feedback Button\n\nClick thumbs up\n\nif the response is accurate or relevant, or\n\nthumbs down\n\nif incorrect or irrelevant.\n\nBe specific in your questions and provide feedback whenever possible to improve the system’s accuracy.\n\nGlitches and Bugs\n\n:\n\nAs Copilot is in\n\nalpha\n\n, occasional issues such as non-functional hyperlinks or inaccurate data may arise.\n\nNon-Functional Links\n\n: Sometimes, Copilot generates links that don’t work. If this happens, refresh the page or manually check the relevant footage on the timeline. Use the feedback button to report this.\n\nIncorrect Activity Identification\n\n: The AI may misidentify objects or activities (e.g., stating that cylindrical components were delivered on a certain date when they weren’t). Always verify this information manually and report incorrect answers using the feedback buttons.\n\nSystem Downtime\n\n: If responses are slow or don’t appear, refresh the page or wait a few minutes before trying again. Persistent issues should be reported to\n\nsupport@evercam.io\n\n.\n\nValidating Responses\n\n: Always verify Copilot’s outputs, such as checking project timelines or records, especially when links or details don’t appear accurate."
