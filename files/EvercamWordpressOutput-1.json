Here’s why.\n\nEyeballs v Algorithms\n\nWith CCTV cameras, the output is images. Don’t bother trying to get data from them, it’s expensive and disappointing.\n\nInstead, use images for what they’re good at — transmitting information into the human brain.\n\nLet the IoT device trigger the event, then look at the images.\n\nThat’s the root of the issue, now here are some details:\n\nConnection Protocols\n\nUnlike every other IoT device, high bandwidth requirements mean that cameras don’t use Bluetooth or Zigbee. We even advise customers to avoid WiFi.\n\nCommunication Protocols\n\nThis is not a place for MQTT or ZeroMQ. Like with the connection protocols cameras are often sending in the region of 1mb/s streaming video and so the protocols designed for small amounts of intermittent data aren’t appropriate.\n\nCloud v Edge\n\nIt’s easy & cheap enough to take the output of a temperature sensor, polling every minute, and store it for almost infinity. With live streaming video, that would start to get expensive. As the survivor of a cloud CCTV business (Camba.tv) I learnt the hard way that it makes more sense to store your video locally if you can. Now, with 64Gb SD cards on the camera, you can.\n\nPrivacy & Data Protection\n\nI can store year’s worth of air quality readings or voltage measurements without worrying too much about personal privacy infringements. A jpeg containing a face or a number plate is quite a different story.\n\nImpact\n\nSometimes, this: Tide Status: 1.3 just doesn’t cut the mustard quite like this:\n\ncontact us https://evercam.io/contact for more information\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

    "title": "Which camera to use for a timelapse ? - Evercam Construction Cameras",

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nAbdelkarim Aridj\nDate : 26-01-2017 Last Modified Date : 15-06-2022\n   \nWhich camera to use for a timelapse ?\n\nThis used to be a pretty easy question, there was really only one choice, a Canon DSLR which had a special feature to take photographs at regular intervals. The camera needed an external power supply and you were left with a heap of high-resolution pictures on an SD card. Here in Ireland you also needed some waterproof box to keep the expensive equipment dry.\n\n\nThese days, there’s a lot more options. Three new contenders, in particular, are worthy of discussion:\n\nThe GoPro. Originally for Snowboarders & Skydivers, this high res, a low-cost camera has time-lapse built in and can last for a few days without power. It’s a quick and easy option for small jobs, especially if they are internal, though GoPros also come with waterproof housings.\n\n The Brinno. This is a camera specially designed for construction timelapse. They are rugged, waterproofed and have a decent battery that is advertised to last several months. These cameras are great in situations where you don’t have any power supply or internet connectivity. The great disadvantage of them is that there is no remote access, so there’s no live view and also there are no alerts if something were to go wrong such as a battery or storage card failure. We would recommend using a Brinno where there is no requirement for recordings other than time-lapse and if there is no way of getting an Internet connection to the camera.\n\n\nThe IP Camera. This is essentially an Internet-connected security camera which we would consider to be the camera of choice for a construction timelapse. The interesting thing here is that this category of camera has, in the last few years,  become capable of very high quality and high-resolution image capture, easily comparable to the professional photography cameras which perform better with good backdrops. Aside from that, they are designed from the ground up to be rugged and to operate from a fixed position for many months, if not years at a time, reliably recording footage. It’s also easy to monitor these cameras remotely to detect if anything has gone wrong so that one can respond promptly. They come with large amounts of storage and most will have mobile apps so that you can access the live & recorded video from anywhere – a great project management tool.\n\nSo, you can see where our preference lies, we clearly think that the IP CCTV Camera is the right tool for the job. That said, for certain cases, we will deploy an alternative camera when circumstances dictate.\n\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nDate : 18-01-2017 Last Modified Date : 28-04-2023\n   \nHow Timelapse & Live Cameras Help More Than Just the Construction Marketing Team\n\nThis article has been cross-posted on the Construction Industry Federation website.\n\nOver the last few years, it has become standard practice to add a timelapse camera to any medium to large construction project. These cameras provide not just a fascinating collage of how a building comes together, but also a valuable record of the building process itself.\n\nEvercam has built a solution for the construction industry that takes this a step further with the addition of a live & recorded view, available in real time to any mobile phone. Suddenly, the timelapse camera becomes an invaluable collaboration tool for everyone involved in a project.\n\nThe beauty of a timelapse camera is that it is positioned with the best overview of a building site, often from a neighbouring tall structure from where one can capture all of the activity at a single glance.\n\nThe familiar adage, a picture tells a thousand words, has never been more true.\n\nWith this information in their pocket, project managers, subcontractors, head office, health & safety officers, quantity surveyors and multiple other key stakeholders have detailed timesaving information at their fingertips. Misunderstandings are avoided, trust is increased and disputes can be resolved faster and more effectively.\n\nEvercam has taken the best of traditional timelapse photography skills and married it with the needs of the modern building site. Our system captures, in high resolution, the entire history of the building project from breaking ground to handover.\n\nWe’ve built unique tools for the construction industry such as Snapmail that capture key stages in a project and send them directly by email to those who need it most. This is a great way of keeping the people in head office and those on site on the same page, directly in their inbox.\n\nWhile Evercam has worked to perfect the software and technology platform for effective construction cameras, we’ve partnered with the best and most established construction photographers and videographers in the industry, Susan Kennedy from Lensmen & the Irish Photo Archive .  Susan’s team take the raw footage and create professionally produced, marketing ready material.

From the early delight at getting a jpeg to refresh on a web page to the large scale cloud CCTV projects, it’s been a long learning experience.\n\nAll the while, Camba.tv and now Evercam have been pushing the frontier of what is possible with or expected from, Cameras. We’ve worked on remote storage for thousands of cameras. We’ve built a beautiful API, timelapses, and many more features.\n\nThen it struck me.\n\nNo one has yet solved the basic, most fundamental problem of working with cameras. Just the simple ability to login and view a camera with the sort of frictionless user experience that we are familiar with in other areas of our lives. For the most part, this experience, for the majority of people, is still broken.\n\nSo what do I want?\n\nI want to login and see my cameras. I want to see the recorded video. I want to share my camera or a recording with someone else. I want to log files. I want to be alerted if my camera has gone offline or if something unexpected has happened (motion detection etc.). I want to be able to work with any type of camera and I don’t want to have to spend hours trying to understand the rules of port forwarding. I want to be relaxed knowing that my camera is not unwittingly exposed to strangers on the Internet and I want this to work on any device, mobile or desktop, that suits me.\n\nLet’s call it Camera Management.\n\nSomehow this reminds me of an advertisement for Honda that I really liked.\n\nEvercam, it’s like writing on bananas for cameras.\n\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

A vantage point which has the camera facing north will produce much clearer and better images than one facing south. The effect of this can be minimised by using cameras with a Wide Dynamic Range and by various colour settings, but it needs to be thought of in advance, just in case the sun does come out.\n\nPrivacy\n\nQuite often you will find that your vantage point unavoidably overlooks someone else’s property. We’ve had cases where this might be a school playground or a private balcony. In both cases, it’s essential that you don’t capture private information that would be in breach of data protection. On most IP Cameras (including models used by Evercam) there is an option for a privacy filter which blanks out specified regions at source. This means that the private information is never captured in the first place, an essential requirement for compliance.\n\nHow high will the building be?\n\nDuh. By seriously. Consider the vantage point’s suitability for the building throughout the lifecycle of the construction process. If you’re going to need to change the location during the build then it’s better to know that up front.\n\nThe Wind\n\nThis is particularly important when mounting onto a crane or a pole. Even if it may seem stable, small vibrations will disturb the quality of the time-lapse. In general, anything up to 2 -3 degrees can be compensated for in post production by various “anti-shake” filters which will align images that are roughly the same. If the shake is much more than that you will end up having a very cropped image.\n\nLicences etc.\n\nThe list is long. CCTV installation in Ireland requires a PSA Licence. Drone photography requires a drone licence. Building sites will require at minimum a safe pass and most will require a method statement and possibly a site specific induction process. Fines can be imposed after the fact, so be sure that you’re covered.\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nBook a demo\nContact\n\n6-7 Granby Row, Dublin 1, Ireland\n+353 1 919 4500\n\n\n\nOther Locations\nIE\nUK\nSG\nAU\nUS\nPL\nConstruction Cameras\nCamera Specs\nProjects\nPricing\nTutorials\nBlog\nResources\nE-books\nCase Studies\nReality Capture\nSitemap\nProductivity\nSoftware Integrations\nProject Management\nMarketing\nA.I. for Construction\nAbout\nTerms & Conditions\nGDPR compliance\nTrust Center\nAbout\nContact Us\nCareers\nTestimonials\nPartners\nBecome An Installer\nFind An Installer\nFeatures\nTime-lapse\nLive View\nRecordings\nGate Report\nX-Ray\nBIM Integration\nDrones in Construction\nProgress Photos\nZoom\nCompare Tool\nMark-up Tool\nGoogle Play\n \nApple Store\n\n \nWhatsApp\n \nGithub\n \nLinkedin\n \nTwitter\n \nFacebook\n \nVimeo\n \nYoutube\n \nInstagram"

These cameras provide not just a fascinating collage of how a building comes together, but also a valuable record of the building process itself.\n\nEvercam has built a solution for the construction industry that takes this a step further with the addition of a live & recorded view, available in real time to any mobile phone. Suddenly, the timelapse camera becomes an invaluable collaboration tool for everyone involved in a project.\n\nThe beauty of a timelapse camera is that it is positioned with the best overview of a building site, often from a neighbouring tall structure from where one can capture all of the activity at a single glance.\n\nThe familiar adage, a picture tells a thousand words, has never been more true.\n\nWith this information in their pocket, project managers, subcontractors, head office, health & safety officers, quantity surveyors and multiple other key stakeholders have detailed timesaving information at their fingertips. Misunderstandings are avoided, trust is increased and disputes can be resolved faster and more effectively.\n\nEvercam has taken the best of traditional timelapse photography skills and married it with the needs of the modern building site. Our system captures, in high resolution, the entire history of the building project from breaking ground to handover.\n\nWe’ve built unique tools for the construction industry such as Snapmail that capture key stages in a project and send them directly by email to those who need it most. This is a great way of keeping the people in head office and those on site on the same page, directly in their inbox.\n\nWhile Evercam has worked to perfect the software and technology platform for effective construction cameras, we’ve partnered with the best and most established construction photographers and videographers in the industry, Susan Kennedy from Lensmen & the Irish Photo Archive .  Susan’s team take the raw footage and create professionally produced, marketing ready material. We can also provide on-site videography, photography and drone-videography, such as used in this video made for the Boland’s Mills development.\n\nEvercam currently has over 50 live construction cameras recording projects around Ireland and have plans to more than double that in 2017. This time, the revolution surely will be televised.\n\nhttps://evercam.io/construction-timelapse\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

This project includes a 16,000 SF community centre, a synthetic turf field, walking paths, a dock, a playground, parking areas, stormwater facilities and essential utilities. \n\nThe site,  formerly a shipyard, required extensive soil remediation before construction could begin. Crews have removed two feet of contaminated topsoil. This highlights the challenges and the importance of revitalizing this area for the community.\n\nMCN Build’s Strategy for Staying on Schedule?\n\nTo ensure transparency and keep the project on schedule, MCN Build is using the Evercam platform for real-time progress tracking. The Construction Visibility platform provides stakeholders with live views of the construction site cameras via shareable links. \n\nThe project superintendent used Evercam’s Time-Lapse Creator (TLC) to produce daily time-lapse videos, document site progress, and provide daily updates to stakeholders, always keeping everyone in the loop.\n\nWhat Makes MCN Build’s Progress Management Effective?\nProgress Tracking and Documentation:  The continuous live-view cameras provide real-time site visibility and project documentation. On-site project managers relied on the Evercam app to monitor and report project progress.\nLogistics Management and Security: Due to the intense logistic activities from the extensive replacement of contaminated soil heaps, MCN Build has used the Evercam Gate monitoring system to improve traffic management. The installation of ANPR cameras allowed managers to automatically capture vehicle license plates and monitor all entering and exiting site activities. This eliminated the need for manual tracking.\nTime-Lapse Progress Updates: The professionally edited time-lapse videos were provided monthly to keep investors informed, ensuring transparency and stakeholder satisfaction.\n\nUsing Evercam’s Construction Visibility Platform, MCN Build kept everyone in the loop and ensured everything stayed on track. This level of transparency and efficiency made the construction process smoother. It also highlighted the importance of creating spaces that truly benefit the community.\n\nTake a look at the construction progress from November 2023 to April 2024. \n\nSparrows Point Park and Recreation Center is a great example of how smart, well-managed projects can bring new life to an area. It builds a stronger sense of community and improves the quality of life for everyone around.\n\nLearn more\nProject Details\nGeneral Contractor:\t\n\nMCN Build\n\n\nSector:\t\n\nPublic utilities\n\n\nCity\tMaryland\nCountry\tUnited States\nPublished Date\t06-06-2024\nRecent Projects\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Additionally, for large projects or multiple job sites, stakeholders can even embed a live stream or have a permanent display on internal digital screens, providing them with a comprehensive view of the project’s progress at all times.\n\nCompare Previous, Current Or Future Flight Models\n\nSimilar to the compare tool that can be used with  Evercam’s fixed-position cameras, Drone View feature also offers the capability to compare previous and current or future flight models. This is a convenient way to compare the as-built project with the BIM model, in 2D, as designed, and to track construction progress by comparing before and after images from your drone flights.\n\nThis is a great way to showcase construction progress, and it is an easy way to create content for social media, internal communications, progress meetings or stakeholder communications.\n\n\nSwitch to 2D Mode Instantly\n\nDrone View not only allows for the visualization of 3D models but also provides the flexibility for project stakeholders in the design team to view 2D models of a project. The feature includes an option to switch into 2D mode instantly within the app, which allows users to view a variety of assets in addition to the 3D model.\n\nThese assets include BIM models, previous drone flights, architectural plans, and blueprints. This feature provides the ability to easily compare these assets and allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the project’s progress. The ability to switch between 3D and 2D modes allows for a more tailored and efficient review process for different stakeholders.\n\nEdit tool\n\nDrone View is not a standalone entity within the Evercam platform, but rather an additional feature that complements the other integrated tools. Users of the Drone View can also utilise other tools such as the edit tool, which is a useful tool for project teams when discussing the progress of the project. It allows for easy identification of areas that may need change orders to be implemented.\n\nEvercam’s Drone view feature provides users with a comprehensive view of past, present, and future flight models. Customers can stay connected with colleagues on-site by utilising the real-time footage from fixed-position cameras and the timeline of different drone flights. This allows project members to easily monitor progress and make sure all necessary items are taken care of, download, and share with team members. This tool is especially useful during daily meetings, as it helps to keep everyone on the same page and plan ahead effectively.\n\nRemote Measuring \n\nDrone View includes a site measurement tool. This tool enables users to measure progress and provide proof of the status of the project. It also allows users to estimate the cost of materials such as pipe, cable, and concrete without having to physically visit the site.\n\nFor example, it’s possible to measure the distance between the project and the nearest optical fibre located on the highway in order to make estimates for connecting to the site. This feature can be particularly useful for cost estimation, project planning, and monitoring progress.\n\nCommunicate Visually with a Tagging System\n\nDrone View offers a user-friendly tagging system that lets users quickly and easily create annotations or tags on the model to highlight important information such as restricted or dangerous areas. This feature is particularly useful for project managers and other stakeholders who need to quickly identify specific areas of the construction site for further attention or action.\n\nFor example, project managers can use the tagging system to assign tasks and monitor progress in real time by checking the camera’s live view. This allows them to quickly and easily identify any areas of the construction site that may be falling behind schedule or require additional resources. The tagging system can be used to communicate important information such as safety hazards or areas that are off-limits to workers, which helps ensure the safety of all personnel on the construction site.\n\nImproving productivity with the integration of weather feature in drone view\n\nDrone View has also been enhanced with the integration of a weather feature, providing critical information for project managers and quantity surveyors to monitor and analyse specific environmental conditions that may impact productivity and working conditions.\n\nAdditionally, The weather feature allows users to easily access historical weather data from the Live View and Recordings tabs, saving time and improving productivity by eliminating the need for multiple clicks. This feature enables project stakeholders to quickly understand and address any project delays caused by weather conditions.\n\nBenefits of Drone View\nCompares the site’s present condition to the plans.\nDetailed representation of the construction site and surrounding area\nIt is simple to switch between the camera view and the 3D model.\nAssess the state of a construction site down to the finest details. \nAll Evercam users can now access and interact with the 3D reconstruction.\n\nDrone View is a game-changer for remote site monitoring and project management in the AEC industry.

Scheduled for completion in 2026, the center is a key part of the university’s “One Simmons” initiative to consolidate all its facilities onto one campus. The new building will house over 1,000 students, and feature social spaces, meeting rooms, dining facilities, and an athletics center.\n\nTo manage the complexities of this large-scale project, Skanska has implemented the Evercam platform for improved oversight. The Evercam platform was chosen to address several key project goals, including: \n\nEnhanced safety: Proactive hazard identification, thorough incident documentation, and reinforcement of a safety-first culture.\nInsurance compliance: Meeting the requirements of the insurance funding group, Zurich.\nEfficient project management: Streamlining project coordination and progress tracking through Evercam’s BIM integration.\nData-driven insights: Analyzing project performance to identify areas for improvement, share best practices, and inform risk averse decision-making.\nBIM Integration for Safety Planning\n\nThe BIM Compare tool allows Skanska to ensure alignment with the project’s design as construction progresses, mitigating issues before they arise. Skanska reports that this proactive approach has also significantly contributed to the adherence to safety standards.\n\n“BIM Compare has been instrumental in our safety planning efforts. By comparing the design model with actual site conditions, we can identify potential hazards and implement preventative measures.”\n\n— Ryan Cardoza, Safety Manager at Skanska.\n\nConstruction Time-lapse for Progress Monitoring\n\nEvercam’s construction time-lapse cameras are used to document the progress of the project, providing videos to easily showcase monthly progress. These construction time-lapse videos allow the team to track milestones, assess construction performance, and identify areas for improvement. The footage serves as both a progress-tracking tool and an internal audit resource.\n\n“So far, it has been a great experience. Being able to see the demo of the existing building from the safety of my own desk has been very enjoyable.”\n\n— Jeffrey Feirstein, Project Manager at Skanska.\n\nUse of Footage for Safety Training\n\nFootage from the project has also been repurposed for training purposes. Evercam jobsite cameras captured the steel sheet suspension process, which was then used to create an internal safety training video for Skanska’s Care For Life program.  This footage, captured while monitoring progress and the site activities during the execution of the work, has been instrumental in enhancing site safety by providing real-world examples of safety practices during construction. The training video showcases how the camera system can support not only oversight but also enhance long-term workforce development period.\n\n Site Documentation and Time-Saving Measures\n\nFollowing an unexpected on-site event, the company promptly turned to Evercam’s footage for post-event analysis\n\n“Evercam recordings played an essential role in supporting specific site analysis. It really gave us a leg up. With the recordings pulled from that day, we were able to save at least 25 hours [of time performing] interviews and official documentation. It saved us a lot of time and energy.”\n\n— Ryan Cardoza, Safety Manager at Skanska\n\nThrough the integration of Evercam’s technology, Skanska continues to maintain a high level of safety and efficiency for the Simmons University project. The use of jobsite cameras has not only streamlined the construction process but also provided Skanska with valuable resources for ensuring compliance and improving safety protocols. As the project progresses, the Evercam platform will continue to play a vital role in its successful completion.\n\nLearn More\n\nProject Details\nGeneral Contractor\t\n\nSkanska\n\n\nProject Type\t\n\nMixed-Use Student Accommodations and Campus Development\n\n\nCity\tBoston\nCountry\tUnited States\nPublished Date\t11-13-2024\nRecent Projects\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

The goal was to replace old facilities with a modern, purpose-built mortuary. This new facility, with its advanced PMCT scanner, is unique in Greater London. It offers more capacity, improved public areas, and better access for staff and visitors. The project also includes upgraded parking and landscaping to create a more welcoming environment.\n\nObjectives and Challenges\n\nThe project faced many challenges, including health and structural issues. There was limited space and a history of antisocial behaviour. The Council needed an innovative solution to manage the complex construction process. Handling communication among multiple stakeholders effectively was also a key concern for this project. Considering these challenges the stakeholders decided to use Evercam’s platform to improve construction monitoring, ensure comprehensive site visibility, and streamline progress reporting.\n\nAn external view of East London Forensic Centre (Courtesy: Waltham Forest Council)\nModern Site Monitoring and Reporting with Evercam\n\nBefore using Evercam construction cameras, site visits were frequent and required significant travel. The clerk of works and the senior project manager made trips of up to 100 miles. Evercam’s live site visibility and automatic daily progress photos via SnapMails changed this process. Remote monitoring significantly reduced the need for physical visits. This real-time capability was particularly helpful for team members in Essex and London. It saved substantial time and travel costs.\n\n“The real-time monitoring capability of the camera system was particularly beneficial for team members who previously had to travel long distances. The use of the camera reduced the frequency of their visits, saving time and resources, while still keeping them well-informed about the project’s progress”\n\n~Council Senior Project Manager\n\nImproved Efficiency and Stakeholder Communication\n\nEvercam’s platform significantly streamlined reporting and presentation preparation. The ability to create custom time-lapse videos reduced the project manager’s preparation time by three hours per presentation. This enhancement improved the effectiveness of stakeholder meetings.\n\n Real-Time Visuals for Faster Decision-Making\n\nDuring construction, the team faced a delay in drainage works. Evercam’s real-time monitoring allowed them to track progress and adjust schedules proactively. This kept the project on track and optimized resource use.\n\n“It made my life a lot easier. I didn’t have to spend so much time preparing presentations because I could just talk through using the time-lapse videos. The drainage was also a concern for us, but we were able to see where they were and where they needed to be in 10 days.”\n\n~Ashana Jones Council Senior Project Manager\n\nAn external view of East London Forensic Centre (Courtesy: Waltham Forest Council)\nReturn on Investment\n\nEvercam’s implementation reduced the need for frequent site visits. This saved travel costs and time. Enhanced security and efficient reporting processes resulted in an estimated ROI of £70,000. The system introduced efficiencies that saved three hours per presentation, improving the quality of stakeholder meetings.\n\nUsing Evercam’s platform in this project proves the benefits of using construction cameras for advanced project management, progress monitoring, and site visibility in construction.

Achieving this globally recognised standard is a testament to Evercam’s commitment to protecting our customers’ data and the high standards we set ourselves when it comes to cyber security. What makes this achievement even better is that the Evercam platform played a key part of the audit process.\n\nThe auditors were very positive about using Evercam’s 360 tool to conduct remote inspections as we learned that remote audits usually rely on webcams or phones. Instead the auditors could inspect our warehouses in different parts of the globe in great detail and at their own pace. It was also very rewarding that they were getting hands-on testing of our platform, as our platform is a critical part of our ISO scope.\n~Charlie Solan, Evercam C.O.O\n\nAccording to Zuza Stefańska, our ISO Project Lead, “the audit process was rigorous with onsite and remote inspections but we passed with flying colours which was down to the hard work of multiple departments, including our Dev, Ops and HR teams. While the main audit is over, the real work starts now as maintaining the ISO standard involves regular surveillance audits so we have to keep trying to improve what we are doing across the business.”\n\nEvercam’s Compliance Officer, Urooj Saeed believes that the main benefit of the ISO 27001:2022 for our customers can be summed up in one word: “Trust – our customer can trust that Evercam takes its responsibilities seriously and its policies, procedures and our product can stand up to  international scrutiny”\n\nThe ISO 27001:2022 Certification follows closely on from Evercam being awarded Construction Line Gold Accreditation, the UK’s benchmark for supplier quality in the construction industry.\n\n \n\nContact Information\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nHow Siemens Energy Uses Evercam to Enhance Project Oversight\n\nSiemens Energy’s scope of work in the IPP Renewed project involves the installation of three 2000P Synchronous Condenser Generators and associated equipment to facilitate the wider project targets. IPP’s goal is to provide the technology and infrastructure to support the shift from coal to natural gas and ultimately to 100% hydrogen by 2045, contributing to its focus on cleaner energy and sustainability.\n\nThe project includes the installation of natural gas turbines, focused on renewable energy and energy storage, particularly utilizing Utah’s unique geological formations for hydrogen storage. These formations are used for energy storage, where hydrogen produced from renewable sources can be stored and later used to fuel power generation, aiding in the transition to cleaner energy.\n\nSiemens Energy’s role is key to the power stabilization targets, as the Synchronous Condenser installation is part of the grid stability infrastructure, ensuring voltage regulation and reactive power management as the grid incorporates more renewable energy sources.\n\nTo ensure seamless project oversight, Siemens Energy is using Evercam’s technology, including construction cameras, BIM Integration, and construction time-lapse. These technologies improve visibility, team collaboration, and progress monitoring all in support of the goal of the project to transition towards sustainable energy.\n\nMaximizing Project Visibility with Construction Cameras\n\nOne of the primary tools Siemens Energy is using on this project is construction cameras, which have played a crucial role in documenting the progress of the IPP Renewed Project’s Synchronous Condenser units. These cameras capture high-quality visual data, improving site documentation and providing real-time updates to stakeholders.\n\nConstruction Time-Lapse \n\nBy transforming an otherwise static construction site into a dynamic, evolving visual record, Siemens Energy can share these time-lapse videos to highlight the scale and success of their work, while also using them for internal analysis and audits. This visual data doesn’t just serve as an impressive marketing tool; it’s also a resource for Siemens Energy’s construction management team. Time-lapse videos offer detailed insights into the jobsite’s progress, allowing project managers to review the footage, track milestones, and identify areas for improvement. The visual documentation is especially useful for internal audits and ensuring the entire team remains accountable.\n\nLive View\n\nIn addition to the time-lapse features, the  Live View functionality has significantly improved on-site management and remote monitoring. Project managers and stakeholders have real-time access to the site, allowing them to see ongoing activities from any location. This real-time insight enables more informed decisions and faster responses to potential challenges.\n\nFor example, Siemens Energy’s construction management team can log into the Evercam platform to verify workforce activity, track subcontractors, and monitor site safety. This level of oversight ensures the project continues to run smoothly, maintains required standards of safety, and enables project managers to track progress without traveling to the site. This remote management capability is not only cost-effective but also helps streamline decision-making across time zones and teams.\n\nBIM Integration\n\nThis project has also integrated BIM into the jobsite cameras for more accurate monitoring and planning. By overlaying BIM models onto site footage through BIM Compare Tool, the team can instantly compare design plans with the live status of construction. This helps ensure that work on-site is aligned with the original design, offering a clear visual reference for progress tracking and quality assurance. In addition to the static comparison,  the use of 4D modeling combines project scheduling with real-time visual data, providing a clear representation of construction phases over time. This tool aids in progress tracking, identifying any discrepancies from the plan, and ensuring seamless coordination across teams.\n\nThe Siemens Energy IPP Renewed Project is more than just a massive energy transformation—it’s a blueprint for how large-scale infrastructure projects can be managed effectively. This is achieved through the use of advanced technologies like construction cameras for real-time monitoring, as well as fostering strong teamwork with transparency and efficiency. \n\nLearn More\n\nProject Details\nGeneral Contractor\t\n\nSiemens Energy\n\n\nProject Type\t\n\nRenewable Energy Transition\n\n\nCity\tDelta\nCountry\tUnited States\nPublished Date\t10-04-2024\nRecent Projects\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Contractors and third-parties shall be re-issued with updated versions of this policy periodically, and following any changes.\n\nDisciplinary Process\n\nWhere a developer performs an activity or activities in breach of this Secure Development Policy, they shall be subject to the disciplinary process documented in the HR Manual, or the applicable service contract.\n\nImprovement\n\nManagement is committed to the continual improvement of our Secure Development Policy, and shall review this document on an annual basis, or whenever an independent review of our organisation's ISMS reveals a non-conformance or opportunity for improvement. The Management Review shall determine if this policy continues to meet the requirements of our organisation.n\n\nManagement also endeavours to plan our business operations so that our applications are not misused, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is done by identifying and assigning separate duties and responsibilities to guard against misuses such as fraud, or malicious insider activities, etc. Where a developer identifies potential conflicts or misuse due to improper planning and assignment of duties, developers should raise their concern immediately with their line manager, or the ISMS Manager.\n\n1. Maintaining Security Awareness\n\nOur organisation recognises the importance of maintaining robust security measures to protect our applications and services against potential vulnerabilities and threats. While malicious attackers constantly seek to exploit weaknesses in software and web-based systems, we are committed to implementing proactive measures to mitigate these risks.\n\nTo achieve this goal, developers are encouraged to stay informed about secure coding practices and emerging threats. While adherence to specific training programs such as the OWASP Top 10 standard is beneficial, we understand that different developers may have varying schedules and learning preferences\n\nKey Points:\n\nAwareness and Education: Developers are encouraged to stay informed about secure coding best practices through a variety of sources, including relevant security alert feeds, blogs, forums, and industry publications.\nContinuous Learning: Developers should regularly review security alerts and notifications to assess their potential impact on our development environment and applications.\nTraining and Development:  In addition to completing the annual formal security awareness training exercise, developers are encouraged to explore supplementary learning opportunities such as self-study options, workshops, or online courses to further their skills in application security. Active engagement in professional development activities is essential for staying abreast of evolving security practices.\nDocumentation: While HR may retain records of certain training activities as part of the employee training program, developers are advised to maintain documentation of any external security training they pursue and submit the documentation to HR. This includes certificates of attendance or completion obtained from sources outside the organisation's provided training. Keeping thorough records and sharing them with HR ensures transparency and completeness in documenting ongoing professional development efforts related to security training.\nCollaboration: Developers should maintain open communication with relevant service and technology providers to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities or issues related to the applications and services they work with.\nData Handling and Retention: Developers should regularly review and adhere to our Policy: Data Handling & Retention Guidelines to ensure compliance with our requirements for the protection and retention of data.\n2. Secure Development Approach\n\nNo matter which software development methodology is used, our organisation requires that information security considerations and secure coding practices are embedded into the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This section provides guidance for how security is considered at each stage of the SDLC. The policies documented should not be considered exhaustive, and developers may identify additional methods for implementing controls.\n\nThe below diagram illustrates how security considerations are typically included throughout the SDLC:\n\n2.1 Defining Requirements\n\nWhen determining the functionality of the proposed new service or service update, security considerations must be included as part of the business requirements. The following policies shall apply:\n\nDevelopers shall ensure that the requirements for information security documented in our Information Systems Security Policy are adhered to.\nDevelopers shall ensure that the data protection principles and retention requirements set out in our Data Handling & Retention Guidelines are adhered to.\nDevelopers shall ensure that the data and assets impacted are identified, recorded to our Critical Asset Register where necessary, and assessed to determine their value and appropriate handling and access requirements.\nDevelopers shall ensure that our Change Control Procedure has been followed for normal, major, and emergency changes. Following our requirements for change control shall ensure that appropriate risk and data protection assessments are conducted, along with identifying applicable legal and regulatory considerations.\nWhere changes are classified as standard changes, developers shall ensure suitable peer review and acceptance controls are built into the development workflow.\nDevelopers should ensure that they consider the availability and capacity requirements of proposed new services or service updates.\nWhere necessary, developers should consider using security sprints as part of the development approach.\n2.2 Security in Design\n\nWhen developing the software service, feature, or application, developers shall ensure security requirements are included in the design stage. By leveraging secure engineering principles, developers will reduce the risk of our services and applications being compromised by malicious attackers. This section documents secure engineering principles that developers should include in the design stage of development. Developers should ensure that they are appropriately trained to understand and implement these principles. Secure engineering principles include, but are not be limited to:\n\nPrinciple\tDescription\nData validation \tData validation may include input validation and output encoding. Whitelisting of characters and translation of characters to safe or approved forms provides protection against attacks such as XSS, XFS, SQL injection, buffer overflow, etc.\nData minimisation\tData collected, processed, and/or generated by the service, feature, or application shall always be limited to what is absolutely necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. For example, where application logs are generated to identify events about capacity, it may be unnecessary to automatically include user names and their device information in the log data.\nAuthentication\tAppropriate authentication mechanisms shall always be used unless the resources or webpages are intended for public access. Requirements for password management are set out in our Information Systems Security Policy, and shall be implemented for all services and users. Where users of a service, feature, or application will be required to configure their own authentication policies as part of a shared responsibility model, appropriate controls and tools shall be developed and provided so that authoritative users can securely control and manage user accounts.\nAuthorisation\tAuthorisation controls shall be used to ensure only authorised services and users have access to application resources, accounts, data, and code. Authorisation should be re-validated periodically to ensure access privileges have not changed.   Where users of a service, feature, or application will be required to perform their own access management as part of a shared responsibility model, appropriate controls and tools shall be developed and provided so that users can set and monitor their required levels of access, and ensure access privileges are correct. \nSecure by default \tDefault settings for services, features, or applications shall always prioritise user or organisational security so that data is automatically protected. This means that users shall be required to take little or no action to ensure the security of their data, and any automatic sharing of data shall be limited to only what is necessary. For example, a user profile may contain personal contact details, education information, and leave status data. Where only the sharing of contact details is necessary for the proper operation of the application, developers shall not:  * Make input fields mandatory for education and leave status information\n* Share any of that data by default  The user should have to opt-in, or enable, any additional sharing features, as required. Users should not have to opt-out of, or disable, the sharing of data.\nSession management \tSession management controls help to prevent user impersonation and compromise of session IDs. Session management controls may include:  * Setting of security flags and secure paths for cookies\nSession and session ID expiry\nPreventing session re-activation and implementing correct session logout behaviour\nSetting correct HTTP referer controls to filter sensitive information  || Fail secure  | Where control mechanisms such as authentication, access control, encryption, and system exceptions may fail, they should not fail in an insecure way. For example, where authentication fails due to an exception, the authentication request should be denied.  || Cryptographic techniques  | Encryption and cryptographic keys used to protect data shall meet the requirements for cryptographic control as documented in our Information Systems Security Policy, or where not specifically documented in our policy, they shall comply with the FIPS 140-2 or equivalent standard (https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules)   Where users of a service, feature, or application will be required to implement their own cryptographic controls as part of a shared responsibility model, legal, or regulatory requirement, appropriate controls and tools for managing encryption shall be developed and provided to users, where possible. This may include the ability to apply data masking techniques to different types of data, or data storage locations, as appropriate. || Error handling | Errors shall be handled securely. Where errors occur, information about the error, and sensitive information such as account and system details, shall not be disclosed in inappropriate ways, such as being displayed back to the user, or included in logs.  || Logging | Logging should contain the relevant event data such as validation failures, system exceptions, unexpected changes to data, copying and export of sensitive information, etc. Log data should also be protected from unauthorised access in line with our Information Systems Security Policy. || File management   | Parameter and validation checks should be set for the management of files to prevent upload of unauthorised or unexpected files, etc. || Threat modelling  | Assists with analysing application components, and identifying and categorising possible threats and requirements for mitigation. This shall also assist in determining security and privacy testing for the service or application so as to proactively secure data and prevent risks from occurring.   || Data lifecycle protection | Mechanisms for the protection of data shall be implemented with consideration for the full lifecycle of the data to ensure it is appropriately protected from the point of collection to destruction.  |\n2.3 Secure Development\n\nWhen carrying out development activities, developers shall not only ensure that the security requirements identified from the design stage are implemented in the development stage, but that necessary security controls are applied to protect the development process and the development environment. Secure development requirements include, but are not limited to:\n\nEnsuring that application, development, and system architecture is secure, including appropriate network, access, and asset protection controls as documented in our Information Systems Security Policy.\nEnsuring that changes are controlled in line with our documented Change Control Procedure.\nEstablishing approved procedures for development which includes controlled workflows, secure code review, acceptance testing, and providing appropriate developer training.\nEnsuring that third-party code such as open-source software is not modified or changed unless it is considered necessary. Modifications to third-party code may introduce unexpected vulnerabilities, and may not be permitted by the third-party.\nEnsuring logging and monitoring is implemented in line with our Information Systems Security Policy.\nEnsuring all necessary information such as system configuration data, code, test data, etc. is identified and backed up in line with our Backup and Recovery Policy & Procedure.\nEnsuring that access to source code is appropriately restricted in line with access control policies documented in our Information Systems Security Policy. Restricting access to source code shall also include ensuring appropriate access controls are enforced for the development tools and software libraries used to manage and produce the source code. Where required, developed source code may be held in escrow.\nEnsuring that development, test, and production environments are separated. Where the environments are not properly separated, differences in access and change control procedures between them may result in vulnerabilities being introduced.\nEnsuring that data used for development and testing purposes is either sanitised or protected in line with data protection requirements. Where live/production data is used in a development or test environment, the data may become accessible to persons who would not normally be authorised to view the data, resulting in potential data breach. Also, where a test or development environment may be compromised due to an undiscovered security weakness, this may lead to a breach of the live/production data.\n2.4 Testing\n\nTo ensure that the identified security controls are implemented correctly, and to reduce the likelihood of security vulnerabilities going undetected, developers shall plan and carry out security testing in the testing stage. Security testing requirements include, but are not limited to:\n\nCarrying out secure code review by peers in line with the development process.\nCarrying out any security testing identified as part of threat modelling exercises in the design stage.\nVulnerability scanning of the application to identify known application vulnerabilities and other security vulnerabilities such as open ports, deprecated SSL/TLS certificates, etc.\nPenetration testing should be conducted bi-annually to ensure thorough examination of the environment for security weaknesses, including but not limited to input validation testing, user enumeration, and system hardening. The results of these penetration tests should be presented to the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), along with a report identifying vulnerabilities and shortcomings revealed by the tests. The CTO is responsible for reviewing these findings and creating a remediation plan to address them. Additionally, the CTO should oversee the implementation of the rectification procedures or actions to ensure the security of the environment is maintained at an optimal level. \nCarry out appropriate acceptance testing of any new or modified information systems in line with our Change Control Procedure.\n2.5 Deployment\n\nWhen deploying new or modified software services, features, or applications, developers shall ensure that security requirements are built into the deployment stage of the process to protect our information systems and code. Security requirements for deployment include, but are not limited to:\n\nEnsuring that secure code review by peers has been performed prior to deployment.\nEstablishing approved procedures for controlling the deployment pipeline which may include approval and code verification controls.\nEnsuring deployments are made only from trusted code and not pulled from untrusted sources.\nEnsuring any credentials with elevated privileges used to run code are protected from unauthorised exposure and use.\nEnsuring required access controls in line with our Information Systems Security Policy are properly implemented to prevent unauthorised access.\nEnsuring that deployments are not scheduled immediately prior to periods of unavailability, such as weekends or leave. Where unforeseen issues arise as a result of the deployment, resolution times may be impacted due to the unavailability of developers.\nEnsuring deployments that may impact data security are documented and communicated in line with our Data Handling & Retention Guidelines, where necessary. This will ensure data processing activities remain transparent to users.\nThe incident response procedure is integrated within each stage of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), ensuring it remains current and responsive. Significant software changes trigger an update to the incident response procedure and corresponding exercises to validate its effectiveness.\n2.6 Post change validation\n\nIf deployed changes affect system availability, rollback mechanisms are in place to restore functionality. The team must adhere to these rollback protocols to minimise disruptions and maintain system stability.\n\nRollback protocol\n\nIn the event of a security issue, vulnerability, or problem arising from a new deployment, such as a critical bug, the rollback protocol must be followed to ensure system stability and data integrity:\n\nRevert Deployment: Immediately deploy the last known working version or branch of the application to restore normal operations.\nData Structure Rollback: If the deployment included a data migration, the data structure must be reverted to its previous state. This should follow the pre-defined migration rollback plan to ensure consistency and prevent data corruption.\nLogging and Notification: Document the issue, and steps taken for rollback, and notify the relevant stakeholders, including security and development teams.\nRoot Cause Analysis: Conduct a post-rollback review to identify the root cause of the issue and prevent recurrence. See Root Cause Analysis\n3. Outsourced Development\n\nWhere it is necessary to outsource development activities to a contractor or third-party provider, our organisation requires that the software, features, and applications developed adhere to our requirements for quality and security. As documented in the communications section of this policy, contractors and third-parties involved in development activities shall be issued with a copy of this document as part of the process for contracting services.\n\nAll third-parties involved in development activities shall be managed in line with our Supplier Due Diligence Policy which sets out our requirements for auditing, data agreements, information security controls, technology supply chain, and intellectual property.\n\nCreated by: Head of Compliance (ISMS team) \n\nCreation date: 01.08.2023\n\nLast modification date:  15.11.2024\n\nDocument approver: Chief Technology Officer\n\nBook a demo\nContact\n\n6-7 Granby Row, Dublin 1, Ireland\n+353 1 919 4500\n\n\n\nOther Locations\nIE\nUK\nSG\nAU\nUS\nPL\nConstruction Cameras\nCamera Specs\nProjects\nPricing\nTutorials\nBlog\nResources\nE-books\nCase Studies\nReality Capture\nSitemap\nProductivity\nSoftware Integrations\nProject Management\nMarketing\nA.I. for Construction\nAbout\nTerms & Conditions\nGDPR compliance\nTrust Center\nAbout\nContact Us\nCareers\nTestimonials\nPartners\nBecome An Installer\nFind An Installer\nFeatures\nTime-lapse\nLive View\nRecordings\nGate Report\nX-Ray\nBIM Integration\nDrones in Construction\nProgress Photos\nZoom\nCompare Tool\nMark-up Tool\nGoogle Play\n \nApple Store\n\n \nWhatsApp\n \nGithub\n \nLinkedin\n \nTwitter\n \nFacebook\n \nVimeo\n \nYoutube\n \nInstagram"

Additional policies governing data management activities will be addressed separately.  \n\nScope\n\nThe scope of this data retention and destruction policy is all information technology systems, software, databases, applications and network resources needed by Evercam Limited to conduct its business. The policy is applicable to all Company employees, contractors and other authorised third-party organisations.\n\nStatement of Compliance\n\nThis policy is designed to be compliant with the U.S. Data Protection Act of 1998, Freedom of Information Act of 2000, Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 and Europe's General Data Protection Regulation.\n\n \n\nData retention and destruction policy compliance is managed by the IT department, with support from Compliance department leadership and subject matter experts. To achieve compliance, data retention and destruction programs include appropriate procedures, and identify staffing and technology resources to meet compliance requirements. Compliance verification (especially for data destruction) is performed monthly by the IT department, internal audit or other appropriate entity. \n\nPolicy\n\nThe Information Technology (IT) department, with support from the Compliance department, is responsible for managing all data retention and destruction activities for the Company. Other departments, such as Finance and Accounting, Operations and Human Resources, are also responsible for providing the IT and Compliance departments with their requirements for data retention and destruction. The IT and Compliance departments are responsible for developing, executing and periodically testing data retention and destruction procedures. The IT and Compliance departments also acknowledge they will comply with appropriate industry standards for data retention and destruction in its activities.\n\nThe company shall develop comprehensive data retention and destruction plans in accordance with good data management practices as defined by established standards.\n\nData retention and destruction activities shall be performed as part of the company's data management program, which administers and manages the overall technology data management program, which includes:\n\nPlanning and design of data retention and destruction activities;\nIdentification of data retention and destruction teams, defining their roles and responsibilities and ensuring they are properly trained and prepared to perform their duties;\nPlanning, design and documentation of data retention and destruction plans;\nScheduling of updates to data retention and destruction risk analyses;\nPlanning and delivery of awareness and training activities for employees and data retention and destruction team members;\nPlanning and execution of data retention and destruction plan exercises;\nDesigning and implementing data retention and destruction maintenance activities to ensure that plans are up to date and ready for use;\nPreparing for management review and auditing of data retention and destruction plan(s); and\nPlanning and implementation of continuous improvement activities for data retention and destruction activities and plans. \n\nFormal Risk Assessments (RAs) and Business Impact Analysis (BIAs) shall include requirements for data retention and destruction activities; RAs and BIAs shall be updated at least annually to ensure they are in alignment with the business and its technology requirements.\n\nData retention and destruction plans shall address electronic data stored on electronic media such as CDs, hard disk drives, solid state disk drives, magnetic tape and other appropriate media.\n\nData retention and destruction plans shall address data stored on non-electronic media (e.g., paper files, microfiche).\n\nData retention and destruction plans shall address electronic information systems (e.g., servers, routers, switches) and components (e.g., cabling and connectors, power supplies, storage racks) and other assets that are currently out of production or scheduled to be phased out of production environments.\n\nData retention plans shall establish the storage requirements and associated metrics (e.g., length of storage, type of storage media) for electronic and non-electronic information as well as systems supporting the IT infrastructure.\n\nData destruction plans shall establish the parameters for destruction of electronic data (e.g., overwriting, reformatting, degaussing, firmware-based erasure, physical data media destruction), non-electronic data (e.g., shredding of hard copy), and systems and components (e.g., third-party destruction services).\n\nData retention and destruction plans shall be periodically reviewed and tested in a suitable environment to ensure that data, databases, media, systems and other relevant elements can be retained or destroyed and that Evercam Limited's management and employees understand how the plans are to be executed as well as their roles and responsibilities.\n\nAll employees must be made aware of the data retention and destruction program and their own roles and responsibilities.\n\nData retention and destruction plans and other documents are to be kept up to date and will reflect existing and changing circumstances.\n\nData Storage\n\nThe cloud recordings are stored on dedicated cloud service providers, primarily on Hetzner servers located in Germany and AWS servers located in Ireland. In addition, physical hard drives are placed at the project site and connected to the cameras for local storage in addition to SD cards located inside the camera. At the end of the project, the customer has the option to retain the physical hard drives or store them securely with us. The SD cards will be destroyed as they only retain 5-7 days worth of data. We take every precaution to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data.\n\nRegular audits are conducted to ensure the integrity and security of the data stored in the cloud and physical hard drives. These routine checks enable us to identify and address any potential issues or concerns promptly, ensuring the safety and confidentiality of our clients' data.\n\nData Retention and Destruction Specifications\n\nFollowing are specific data retention and destruction technical requirements:\n\nRetention Periods\n\nEvercam typically stores a copy of client data for 90 days after a project has been completed, unless the client requests to delete the footage earlier. After this period, data storage can be extended at the Client's expense, with several storage options available. The data is stored both on cloud-based servers and physical hard drives for redundancy and backup purposes.\n\nSee also Project Archiving\n\nData/System Retention\n\nCloud recordings will continue to be stored on dedicated cloud service providers, primarily on Hetzner servers located in Germany for the agreed retention period. Hard drives will be stored in the nearest Evercam HQ for the agreed retention period. Regular audits are conducted to ensure the integrity and security of the data stored in the cloud and physical hard drives. These routine checks enable us to identify and address any potential issues or concerns promptly, ensuring the safety and confidentiality of our clients' data.\n\nOnce the agreed retention period has been reached, the Client will choose from one of the following options:\n\nExtend: Data will continue to be stored by Evercam. The nature of the storage and associated costs to be agreed at the time of extension\n\nTransfer: Data will be transferred to the Client. The manner in how the data is transferred and associated costs to be agreed the time of transfer \n\nDelete: The Client will confirm that they will wish for all data to be deleted and Evercam will provide a formal Data Deletion Certificate.\n\nEvercam reserves the right to delete data after the agreed data retention period has expired.\n\nData Retrieval (Hard Drive) \n\nEvercam will engage with the Client nominated site contact to coordinate the removal of the hard drives from the site and for them to be shipped by a trusted courier to the nearest Evercam office (see Appendices). As logistics can vary per site, hard drive retrieval may be carried out by an Evercam nominated 3rd party or in conjunction with the nominated Client site contact. The best approach for each site will be agreed in conjunction with Client.\n\nResponsibility for, and costs of, camera decommissioning and hardware retrieval will be agreed on a per project basis due the logistical variations. \n\nData Recovery, Fire and Theft (Cloud Recording and Local Recordings)\n\nCloud Recordings are stored in ISO27001 certified data centres with their own internal Security and Disaster Recovery protocols. If required, Evercam can use the Local Recordings stored on the physical hard drive to repopulate the Cloud recordings that are accessible to the Client on the Evercam platform.\n\nLocal Recordings, which are stored on physical hard drives, will be secured in the nearest Evercam regional HQ. The hard drive will be stored in secured areas where necessary steps are taken to protect them against fire, theft and any other physical damage. The hard drives themselves are also encrypted.\n\nRetention and Destruction Requests\n\nTo initiate the process of data deletion, the client can send a request to our support team at support@evercam.io. Our team will verify the request with the nominated Client contact and take the necessary steps to securely delete the data from our servers and physical media. A Certificate of Deletion or Retention can be provided upon request, as the case may be.\n\nData Destruction Procedures\n\nOnce the data retention period has expired, or if the client requests deletion of their data, Evercam ensures complete and secure removal of the data. This involves deleting the data from the servers and wiping the hard drives of any physical media to prevent any unauthorised access or recovery of the data. We take every precaution to ensure that the data is completely and irreversibly erased, in accordance with industry best practices and data privacy regulations. \n\nData can be sent to the customer on request (physical HDD or uploaded). Charges will apply and will be quoted at time of client request.n\n\nCreated by: Compliance Manager (ISMS team)\n\nCreation date: 17.02.2023\n\nLast modification date: 18.02.2025\n\nDocument approver: Head of Compliance\n\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

A failure to properly plan for, and respond to, incidents may put our services, and the information of our employees, customers, and third-parties, at risk, resulting in reputational damage and potential financial loss. This document details how our organisation responds to incidents.\n\nScope\n\nThis procedure shall be applied to all information security incidents that may impact the information and information systems that fall within the scope of our ISMS.\n\nAudience\n\nAll employees, contractors, and third-parties who have a role in identifying and responding to incidents that impact our information and information systems shall follow this Incident Response Procedure. These people include, but may not be limited to:\n\nSenior management\nManagers\nDepartment heads\nSystem administrators\nNetwork engineers\nSystem & asset owners\nContractors\nIT support\nIT service providers\nData protection professionals\nSecurity professionals\n\nFor the purposes of this document, the employees, contractors, and third-parties who have a role in our incident response procedures shall be collectively referred to as \"incident responders\".\n\nCommunication\n\nThis Incident Response Procedure shall be communicated to all employees and agency staff as part of the relevant department training programme, and periodically following any changes to the procedure, or prior to any incident response training exercises. All contractors and third-parties providing IT and operations services, or outsourced incident monitoring and response, shall be provided with a copy of this procedure as part of the process for contracting services. Contractors and third-parties shall be re-issued with updated versions of this procedure periodically, and following any changes. Contractors and third-parties shall also be re-issued with the latest version of this procedure when engaging in incident response training exercises. Members of the Incident Response Team (IRT) shall retain offline copies of this document for reference in the event that our information systems become unavailable during an incident.\n\nDisciplinary Process\n\nWhere an incident responder identifies a potential incident and knowingly ignores an incident, or fails to respond to the incident in breach of this Incident Response Procedure, they shall be subject to the disciplinary process documented in the Company Manual, or the applicable service contract.\n\nImprovement\n\nThis document is reviewed for improvement in several ways. They are:\n\nManagement review on an annual basis to determine if the procedure continues to meet the requirements of the organisation\nIndependent review of our organisation's ISMS which may identify areas of non-conformance or opportunity for improvement\nThe procedure is to be updated based on the tests results from incident response and BCB exercises\n\nManagement also endeavours to plan incident response procedures so that our information and information systems are not misused or compromised during a security incident, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is done by identifying and assigning separate duties and responsibilities to guard against damaging insider activities. Where an incident responder identifies potential conflicts in the carrying out of incident response activities, incident responders should raise their concern immediately with their line manager, or the ISMS Manager.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe Incident Response Procedure has been developed based on best practice principles for responding to information security incidents. Briefly, the primary stages of incident response are:\n\nPreparation\nIdentification\nContainment\nEradication\nRecovery\nLessons learned\n\nThe diagram below illustrates our Incident Response Procedure:\n\nn\n\nReporting\n\nIncident responders may become aware of potential incidents from various sources, including customers and third-parties. Our employees, contractors, and third-parties are prepared to report incidents as follows: Users report directly to IT or their line managers in line with our Information Security Policy and Security Awareness Training Course/training programmes; Administrators report directly to the IRT in line with our Information Systems Security Policy.\n\nFirst Response\n\nOnce an incident responder has been made aware of a potential incident, they shall prepare for possible escalation of the incident by:\n\nCarrying out a preliminary assessment of the incident to determine if it is a potential security incident;\nNotifying the Incident Response Lead immediately where it is confirmed to be a potential security incident;\nAssisting the incident reporter in performing initial containment activities, such as disconnection from the network;\nAvoiding making any changes to affected information and information systems, where possible;\nEnsuring that any users or other third-parties do not touch or remove affected equipment, where possible.\nMobilising the Incident Response Team\n\nOnce the Incident Response Lead has been alerted to a potential information security incident, they shall:\n\nRefer to the Incident Response Contact Sheet and contact IRT members and organise an initial meeting to confirm that the incident is a security incident, and determine an initial criticality level for the incident.\nThis can be via conference call or a face-to-face team meeting, as appropriate.\nOpen an Incident Report once the security incident is confirmed and record the initial meeting details. Contact senior management or relevant department heads to notify them of the incident.\nCall a formal \"War Room\" meeting of the IRT. Depending on the criticality of the incident, not all IRT members may be required for the meeting.\nMeeting security considerations\n\nTo minimise the risk of unofficial communication of the incident, the venue should not be in a public area. The venue should also not be located in an area with limited access to communications. Alternatively, the meeting may be held via conference call or other web-based conferencing services. Where there is a need to use conferencing services outside of the provided business services, the Incident Response Lead shall ensure that meeting invites to the conference or video call require authentication to join, and that the service is secure in line with our Information Systems Security Policy.\n\nDetermining incident criticality\n\nDetermining a criticality level for the security incident assists the IRT in deciding who to notify, and what resources are necessary to resolve the incident. For example, where the criticality is low, notifying all members of the management team may not be required. In situations where more than one incident may be occurring, prioritising the incidents will allow them to be handled in the correct order. Our organisation uses the below criteria to help determine the criticality of the security incident. They should be used as guidance only, and should not be considered exhaustive:\n\nCriticality \tDescription \nLow\t* Less than 5 user laptops or computers infected with malware\nData breach of some information classified as \"Internal\"\nData breach of 1 person's personal data\nUnauthorised access of a user to a non-critical information system\nSuccessful phishing attack on 1 user\nUnavailability of a non-critical information system which doesn't impact customers || Medium  | * 1 or more departments with laptops or computers infected with malware\nData breach of some information classified as \"Confidential\"\nData breach of personal data impacting up to 10 people\nUnauthorised access of a user to a critical information system\nSuccessful phishing attack on up to 5 users\nUnavailability of several non-critical information systems causing disruption to business operations || High | * Most departments and endpoints impacted by malware\nData breach impacting Customer Data\nData breach of \"Highly Confidential\" data\nData breach impacting the personal data of more than 10 people\nUnauthorised access of a malicious attacker to critical information systems\nSuccessful phishing attack which has resulted in financial loss\nUnavailability of critical information systems impacting customers |\nAssessment\n\nOnce the IRT is formally assembled, they shall perform the following activities:\n\nDetermine if the incident is ongoing, and what steps can be taken towards containing it;\n\nDetermine the possible cause of the incident.\n\nWhere the cause is known this may also assist with containment.\n\nDetermine the impact of the incident by identifying:\n\nAny information that may be compromised or at risk, and any controls in place to protect the data such as encryption, backups, etc. Affected infrastructure e.g. servers, communications equipment, cloud-based infrastructure, computers, office locations, etc.\nAffected services e.g. intranet, CRM, etc. Affected customers.\nAffected departments.\nHow long services have been unavailable for, where relevant.\n\nBased on the impact assessment, determine any additional resources required to resolve the incident.\n\nDetermine if digital forensics will be required, and what evidence may need to be collected.\n\nDetermine if third-party support is required for containment, eradication, recovery, and/or forensics activities and initiate contact.\n\nDetermine the relevant authorities and third-parties that may need to be notified, such as law enforcement, data protection supervisory authorities, customers, service providers, etc. and initiate contact.\n\nRecord all meeting minutes and assessment information directly to the Incident Report, where available.\n\nContainment, Eradication, & Recovery\n\nOnce the security incident has been assessed, and all necessary resources mobilised to resolve the incident, the IRT shall:\n\nOversee all steps taken to contain, eradicate, and recover from the threat, ensuring that relevant decisions and actions taken are recorded for inclusion in the Incident Report\nEnsure that potential evidence is identified, and that all incident responders are informed of the correct handling procedures\nEnsure that any changes raised to resolve the incident, such as emergency vulnerability patching, are made in line with our Change Control Procedure\nEnsure that any business continuity activities performed to recover services are done in line with our Business Continuity Plan\nHandling potential evidence\n\nWhere forensic investigation of the incident is required, our organisation shall appoint a qualified third-party to carry out the investigation. However, incident responders may still need to handle and secure potential evidence. Incident responders shall: Avoid making any changes to data, or accessing the original system, where possible. Avoid powering off affected endpoints, where possible. This will allow volatile data to be preserved. Keep a record of what they did and when they didn't i.e. from arriving on scene, to handling equipment, to performing any containment tasks, to securing equipment, etc. Ensure that any users or other third-parties do not touch or remove affected equipment. Take photos or video of the equipment or area where this may be helpful to do so. Ensure that any photos, video, equipment or other evidence is stored securely and only accessible to authorised persons. Where evidence may need to be accessed, moved, or transferred, ensure that chain of custody is recorded. Where evidence is collected by the third-party forensic investigator, ensure that any Chain of Custody Form(s) are completed, signed, and stored securely\n\nCommunication\n\nCommunication is a key element of effective incident response. Without it, incident responders may not know how or when to act, key decision-makers may not have all the necessary information required to make effective decisions, third-parties and customers may not know when to expect services to be re-established, communications officers may not know what to communicate to the public, and authorities may not be properly notified in line with legal requirements.\n\nThe IRT shall be responsible for maintaining effective communications throughout the incident by:\n\nEnsuring approved means of internal communication are established so that all required incident responders are contactable, taking into consideration the availability of company systems, equipment, and mobile phones.\nEnsuring that relevant department heads or line managers are delegated to pass on all necessary communications to employees, contractors, and third-parties they are responsible for.\nEnsuring that communications are accurately tracked and documented for reporting purposes. Where legal action may result from the incident, it may be advisable to take audio recordings of important communications. These audio recordings shall be handled as evidence in line with section 1.5.1 of this document.\nEnsuring that details of the security incident are not communicated to unauthorised persons.\nEnsuring external stakeholders such as customers, regulatory authorities, law enforcement, suppliers, etc. are notified of the incident, as required.\nEnsuring that all calls regarding the incident are properly directed e.g. where the media may make contact, this should be directed to the line manager or department head responsible for public communications. Liaising with the public communications team to ensure all public communications are approved prior to release.\nIncident Conclusion\n\nWhile some aspects of recovery may still be ongoing, it may no longer be necessary to have the IRT mobilised. At this point, the Incident Response Lead shall: Determine if the security incident has been resolved to an acceptable degree. Review the Incident Report and other relevant documentation to ensure all necessary information is recorded, accurate, and appropriately secured. Schedule follow-up meetings where required, such as in situations where recovery is ongoing. Inform management and other relevant department heads that the IRT is no longer required for the incident and will be ceasing immediate incident response activities. Schedule a lessons-learned session for post-incident analysis.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nWhile the handling and resolution of a security incident can be a stressful event, it is crucial that the IRT and other relevant incident responders take time to carry out post-incident analysis. Analysing the incident will allow the IRT to identify possible improvements, both in the handling of the incident, and in current security controls. The IRT shall:\n\nCarry out a post-incident analysis at a scheduled date; Identify possible improvements; Identify possible outstanding risks, such as areas that may be impacted by a similar incident occurring;\n\nCarry out a risk assessment in line with our Risk Management Process;\n\nEnsure all improvements are recorded to the Improvement Register, where required;\n\nEnsure all risks are recorded to the Risk Register, where required;\n\nEnsure the lessons learned are recorded to the Incident Report; Close the incident, and record this in the Incident Report.\n\nRoles & Responsibilities\n\nThe roles and responsibilities required for carrying out our Incident Response Procedure are defined below. There may be situations where roles may be combined, or they may be carried out by the same person. The below roles and their descriptions should not be considered exhaustive:\n\nRole \tDescriptions and Responsibilities \nIncident Response Lead\tThe Incident Response Lead is the first point-of-contact for the IRT.

We also need to manage information security risks that may arise with any disruptions to services and recovery efforts, and ensure our information security controls are not compromised during the disruption. Failure to meet our requirements for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of our services and associated information assets may put the information of our employees, customers, and third-parties, at risk, and breach our SLAs. This document details how our organisation responds to service disruptions.\n\nScope\n\nThis business continuity plan (BCP) shall be applied to our business critical information systems and services that fall within the scope of our ISMS.\n\nAudience\n\nAll employees, contractors, and third-parties who have responsibility for planning and initiating business continuity activities shall adhere to this BCP. These include, but may not be limited to:\n\nManagers\nDepartment heads\nSystem administrators\nNetwork engineers\nSystem & asset owners\nContractors\nSystem architects\nIT support\nIT service providers\n\nFor the purposes of this document, the employees, contractors, and third-parties who carry out these roles shall be collectively referred to as \"continuity managers\".\n\nCommunication\n\nThis BCP shall be communicated to all employees and agency staff as part of the relevant department training programme, and periodically following any changes to the procedure, or prior to any BCP training exercises. All contractors and third-parties providing BCP and continuity services, or outsourced incident monitoring and response, shall be provided with a copy of this procedure as part of the process for contracting services. Contractors and third-parties shall be re-issued with updated versions of this procedure periodically, and following any changes. Contractors and third-parties shall also be re-issued with the latest version of this procedure when engaging in BCP training exercises. Members of the BCP Team shall retain offline copies of this document for reference in the event that our information systems become unavailable during an incident.\n\nImprovement\n\nThis document is reviewed for improvement in several ways. They are:\n\nManagement review on an annual basis to determine if the procedure continues to meet the requirements of the organisation\nIndependent review of our organisation's ISMS which may identify areas of non-conformance or opportunity for improvement\nBCP testing and training exercises conducted at planned intervals\n\nManagement also endeavours to plan business continuity activities so that our information and information systems are not misused, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is done by identifying and assigning separate duties and responsibilities to guard against misuses such as fraud, or malicious insider activities, etc. Where a continuity manager identifies potential conflicts or misuse of information systems due to improper planning and assignment of duties when carrying out business continuity activities, continuity managers should raise their concern immediately with their line manager, or the ISMS Manager.\n\n1. Procedure\n\nThe diagram below illustrates the overall procedure for our BCP. Incidents are typically raised and managed in line with our Incident Response Procedure, and where business operations are disrupted, the required business continuity and disaster recovery activities would take place during the mobilisation of the Incident Response Team (IRT) and recovery stage of the Incident Response Procedure (section 1.3 and section 1.5).\n\nThe procedure consists of the following steps:\n\nDetermine what areas and functions are impacted;\nDetermine if third-party involvement is required for disaster recovery activities;\nDetermine if the incident requires evacuation or other health and safety considerations;\nInitiate the relevant disaster recovery plan and restore the systems, locations, and services as required;\n\nDocument any issues encountered as lessons learned.\n\n2. Key Business Areas\n\nThe following are the key business areas we have identified that impact the continuity of our services and business operations, and that fall within the scope of this BCP. These areas have been identified through the development of our Critical Asset Register and associated risk assessment activities in line with our Risk Management Process.\n\n2.1 Personnel\n\nThe ability to ensure the health and safety of our personnel, carry out core business activities, and initiate recovery activities is critical to our BCP. The following personnel are teams or individuals who play a key role in business continuity activities. A contact list of relevant continuity managers is maintained in the Business Continuity Plan Contact Sheet.\n\nDepartment/Team \tNo. of contacts \tLocation\nIT & Devs\t3\tRemote\nIncident Response Team \t5\t2 in HQ and 3 remote \nHR\t2\t1 in HQ and 1 remote\nCOO\t1\tIn HQ\nSite Ops\t4\tWarehouse locations in HQ, GE, UK, USA\n2.2 Physical Sites\n\nWhere a physical location is necessary to carry out crucial business operations and recovery activities the buildings become key business areas, and appropriate redundancy measures should be put in place where that location becomes unavailable.

Failure to meet our SLAs with our customers may result in reputational damage, penalties, and may cause our business to cease operating. Additionally, failure to meet our agreements with our service providers may result in critical services being terminated. The following is a list of the services we provide to our customers and third-parties.\n\nService \tHosted Location / Dependency\tCustomers / Third-Parties Impacted\tService SLA / Compliance Requirement\nGithub(code) \tCloud in USA (Seattle and Northern Virginia)\tCustomer \tTeam Plan (Github Team) Github Customer Terms (link) \nEvercam software services\tCloud, Hetzner and AWS Data Centres\tCustomers\tSLA\nFootage from the client site\tCloud, Hetzner and AWS Data Centres, Hard Drives\tCustomers\tData Protection Act 2018 and GDPR \nInvoice payment \tCloud-based third-party expenses service, banking provider\tService providers\tServices contract and payment agreement\n2.4 Business Services\n\nAlong with our services to customers, we may also need to ensure continuity for critical internal services.

Roles & Responsibilities\n\nThe roles and responsibilities for carrying out our BCP are defined below. Depending on the type of disruption and services impacted, different continuity managers may be required to step into these roles. The below roles and their descriptions should not be considered exhaustive:\n\nRole \tDescription & Responsibilities\nIncident Response Team (IRT)\tWhen a potential incident is identified, the IRT shall initiate our Incident Response Procedure. The IRT shall be responsible for:* Determining an initial criticality of the incident in line with the Incident Response Procedure\nWhere there is unavailability or disruption of services, notifying the BCP Team so that BCP activities can begin\nMaintaining oversight of BCP activities to ensure they are carried out by the BCP Team as planned\nHandling incident communications in line with the Incident Response Procedure\nEnsuring the BCP Team document any issues for inclusion in the Incident Report || BCP Team | Where an incident has resulted in the unavailability or disruption of services, the BCP Team forms to execute the relevant continuity activities. The BCP Team shall consist of continuity managers that are relevant to the services impacted, and not all members of the BCP Team may be required to participate. For example, where services in a third-party data centre are impacted, it would not be necessary for the HR Lead to carry out any evacuation or health and safety activities. In some situations, members of the BCP Team may also be members of the IRT. In these cases, the Incident Response Lead shall ensure that the team member's duties are appropriately prioritised and supported to reduce potential conflict. The BCP Team is responsible for:* Liaising with the IRT to communicate the status of BCP activities and estimated recovery times\nDetermining the priority of BCP activities once the incident is assessed\nEnsuring BCP activities are carried out as planned\nDocumenting any issues with the execution of the planned activities such as recovery problems, unexpected dependencies, communication issues, etc. || Technology Lead | The Technology Lead is familiar with disaster recovery procedures for all technology services provided to customers, third-parties, and internally as documented in section 2 of this document. The Technology Lead should be a person with suitable authority and expertise in the operations team, and should also be able to facilitate emergency access to systems and technology resources, should this become necessary during the incident. The Technology Lead is responsible for:* Determining which information systems and assets are impacted\nInitiating and overseeing the relevant disaster recovery procedures\nLiaising with the IRT to communicate the status of disaster recovery activities\nEnsuring any issues are documented and provided to the IRT as required || Information Security Lead | The Information Security Lead provides guidance and information regarding our business' requirements for information security, and assists with identifying potential risks, during BCP activities.  || Data Protection Lead | The Data Protection Lead provides guidance and information where disruption of services may impact our ability to meet regulatory requirements such as making personal data available. For example, in an emergency situation where paper records need to be moved from a site, the Data Protection Lead would provide advice and assistance with moving the personal records to ensure their safety, security, and accessibility. Another example may be where recovery of cloud-based services require infrastructure and data to be moved to a different region. In this situation, the Data Protection Lead would provide guidance on the legal requirements of moving the data to the new region.  || HR Lead | The HR Lead is responsible for carrying out business continuity activities that involve the health and safety of personnel and visitors during emergency events. The HR Lead should be a person with suitable authority in the HR department, and should have expert knowledge of health and safety requirements, and emergency contact procedures. || Facilities Lead | The Facilities Lead manages the physical security of our physical sites and is responsible for providing access to our recovery sites and/or alternative working areas where our primary offices may become unavailable. The Facilities Lead may also need to advise on physical security and access requirements to ensure physical security requirements are maintained in the alternative sites, where available. The Facilities Lead should be a person with the appropriate levels of authority in their area so that emergency access is facilitated and managed, where required. |\n4. Plan Execution\n\nIn line with the procedure documented in section 1, the following BCP activities should be carried out prior to initiating any disaster recovery procedures. The activities carried out during an incident will vary depending on the criticality of the incident, and the key areas affected. The activities listed below are not in order of priority; the BCP Team shall determine the priority of the activities as part of the incident assessment.\n\nOnce all relevant personnel, third-parties, and resources have been organised, disaster recovery procedures for the affected services should be initiated as required.\n\nActivity \tContinuity Manager/s Responsible\nIdentify the key business areas impacted (section 2 above)\tTechnology LeadHR LeadInformation Security Lead\nIdentify required Disaster Recovery procedures\tTechnology LeadHR LeadInformation Security Lead\nContact emergency services\tHR Lead\nContact technology managed services providers (third party providers: GitHub, GitLab, data centres)\tTechnology Lead\nContact key personnel involved in health and safety procedures\tHR Lead\nContact access key holders at affected sites (warehouses in EU, UK, USA and HQ) to facilitate access and/or evacuation\tFacilities Lead, Site Ops leaders \nContact key personnel involved in disaster recovery procedures\tTechnology LeadInformation Security Lead\nOrganise emergency remote access to sites and services\tTechnology LeadInformation Security Lead\nOrganise emergency equipment for key personnel (laptop, mobile phone, access cards, security tokens, etc.)\tTechnology LeadInformation Security Lead\n5. Continuity Testing\n\nWhere our BCP is untested, our organisation may fail to carry out the plan as expected, resulting in unacceptable disruption to the key systems and services identified in section 2 of this document, possible risk to personnel, and/or loss of information. To ensure our BCP, and relevant disaster recovery procedures, are accurate and work as expected, the following is required:\n\nAdministrators are required to identify and document system recovery and information backup procedures in line with section 3.8 of our Information Systems Security Policy. The Technology Lead assigned to the BCP Team shall work with administrators to ensure disaster recovery procedures for the key systems and services identified in section 2 of this plan are identified and documented.\nAdministrators are required to test recovery procedures and backups at regular intervals in line with section 3.8 of our Information Systems Security Policy. The Technology Lead assigned to the BCP Team shall work with administrators to ensure the disaster recovery procedures are appropriately tested at the agreed intervals. This will provide reasonable assurance that key systems and information can be recovered safely, and as expected, during a disruptive event.\nThe Technology Lead assigned to the BCP Team shall work with administrators to ensure that all disaster recovery procedures relevant to our key systems and services are kept accurate and up-to-date, taking into account the results of the testing performed.\nThe BCP Team shall ensure that appropriate BCP testing and training exercises, as previously mentioned in the Improvement section of this document, are identified and carried out at approved intervals. Testing and training exercises may include, but are not limited to:\nDeveloping testing and training exercises based on scenarios that have occurred previously within our organisation;\nDeveloping testing and training exercises from other sources relevant to our organisation's industry, technology, or threat intelligence gathered in line with section 1 of our Information Systems Security Policy\nThe BCP Team shall ensure that testing and training exercises are appropriately documented so that any identified improvements and/or risks can be reviewed and raised to our Improvement Register and/or Risk Register, as appropriate. Incident Report records may be used for documenting testing and training exercises provided they are clearly marked as test exercises.\n\nn\n\nCreated by: (ISMS team) \n\nCreation date: 04.08.2023\n\nLast modification date: 20-01-2025\n\nDocument approver: Director of support\n\nn\n\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

We’ve decided to open source all of our code because we believe it is the best way to achieve our goal:\n\nTo build the best camera management software in the world.\n\nWe believe the camera software industry is being held back by a proprietary attitude that was better suited to the last generation of closed circuit TV systems.\n\nWe believe that the main difficulty in developing good, universal software for cameras is the difficulty of dealing with the many unexpected scenarios and edge cases.\n\nThis is a problem perfectly suited to the many eyes approach of the open source community.\n\nAlready today much of our code is available on Github under the Apache 2.0 licence. Over the next few weeks we will be opening up the rest of it (some of it needs a little polishing first).\n\nWe plan, over the coming years to cultivate an active developer community around the Evercam codebase that will be able to build high quality, robust innovative applications around an open camera platform that works reliably, securely and openly.\n\nWe want to underline that this is not a side-project led by people who are forced to juggle it with together with their day jobs. For the 9 full-time employees of Evercam, this IS our passion and we’re here for the long term.\n\nThe world deserves better camera software, it’s about time we got it.\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of the information we use ensures that the operations we perform, and the services we provide, continue to meet our business objectives, comply with regulatory and legal requirements, and fulfil the requirements of our stakeholders. It also ensures that any personal data we process about our employees and customers is kept secure, minimising any potential risks or harm that may be caused by a breach of that data. \n\nManagement is committed to the security of our information, and have developed and approved this information security policy in line with the requirements of the ISO 27001 standard for information security, and our organisation's business requirements.\n\nThis document sets out the approved information security policy so that it can be clearly communicated to all employees, contractors, and other relevant third-parties.\n\nScope\n\nThis policy shall apply to all the business processes and information processing activities that fall within the scope of our organisation's Information Security Management System (ISMS). For simplicity, we consider all work-related activities of employees, contractors, or other relevant third-parties to be within the scope of this policy document unless explicitly excluded.\n\nAudience\n\nAll employees, contractors, and other relevant third-parties shall adhere to this Information Security Policy while performing work-related activities as part of their day-to-day duties. For the purposes of this document, policy instructions directed at employees shall also apply to contractors, and other relevant third-parties, and shall be collectively referred to as \"users\". Where discussing the classification and handling of information, users with overall responsibility for the data shall be referred to as the \"data owner\".\n\nCommunication\n\nThis Information Security Policy shall be communicated to all employees and agency staff as part of our employee induction programme, and periodically following any changes to the policy. All contractors and other relevant third- parties shall be provided with a copy of this policy document as part of the process for contracting services, and shall be re-issued with updated versions periodically following any changes to the policy.\n\nDisciplinary Process\n\nWhere an employee, contractor, or other relevant third-party performs an activity or activities in breach of this Information Security Policy, they shall be subject to the disciplinary process documented in the Company Manual or the applicable service contract.\n\nImprovement\n\nManagement is committed to the continual improvement of our Information Security Policy, and shall review this document on an annual basis, or whenever an independent review of our organisation's ISMS reveals a non-conformance or opportunity for improvement. The Management Review shall determine if this policy continues to meet the requirements of our organisation.\n\nManagement also endeavours to plan our business operations so that our information and information assets are not misused, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is done by identifying and assigning separate duties throughout our critical business activities to guard against misuses such as fraud, or errors in data processing activities, etc.\n\nWhere a user identifies potential conflicts or misuse of information or information assets due to improper planning and assignment of duties, users should raise their concern immediately with their line manager, or the ISMS Manager. \n\nClassification & Handling of Information\n\nTo ensure that the information we process is handled appropriately and securely, it is important that all users know how to identify the sensitivity of the data, and follow our requirements for how to handle that data. This section sets out how our organisation classifies our information, and how users should handle that information.\n\nData Classifications\n\nAll data shared with customers should be converted to PDF before sending unless it's a collaborative document, in this case it should contain a label \"draft\" or \"work in progress\". In addition to the table below, users shall review and adhere to the data handling principles set out in the supporting document, Data Handling & Retention Guidelines. This will ensure that even unclassified data is properly handled and protected.\n\nConfidentiality Level\tDescription\tTypical Examples\tLabelling\tLegal/Regulatory Considerations\tHandling\tAvailability/Disposal\nPublic\tInformation that is or can be made publicly available.\tpublishing and marketing materials, website content, published financial statements, social media communication and content, advertised job titles and roles, product catalogues and brochures\tNo labelling required.

This section provides detail on our approved policy for transferring data.\n\n1.1.1   Digital data\n\nWhere there is a requirement to transfer internal, confidential, or highly confidential digital data outside of our organisation, the following shall apply:\n\nUsers shall ensure that they use only the approved method for transferring the data. These methods are approved by data owners and system administrators. Examples include, but are not limited to:\nForced TLS\nSecure web transfer e.g. secure web-portals, API, etc. SFTP\nGPG\nApproved document sharing methods such as Google Drive\nEncrypting individual files and sending as email attachments \n\nWhere users encrypt individual files as email attachments, the encryption key must be sent to the recipient using a second channel, such as SMS, or phone call. Users must never send both the data and the encryption key via email.\n\n1.1.2   Physical data\n\nWhere there is a requirement to transfer internal, confidential, or highly confidential data in physical format such as paper records, backup media, tape, CD/DVD, USB, etc. the following shall apply:\n\nUsers shall use only approved couriers for physical media collection and transfer. Couriers that are approved for use ensure the required levels of security in handling and delivering the physical media.\nUsers shall ensure that physical media storing digital data, such as USB, hard disk, etc. is encrypted wherever possible.\nUsers shall ensure that physical media is packaged in a way that does not allow the physical media to be accessed and/or damaged during transit. For example, with backup tape media, this may include secure containers provided by the backup tape collection and storage provider, etc.\nUsers shall request confirmation from the courier that the package has been delivered as expected, and that it has been signed for by the intended recipient, or persons nominated by the recipient.\nUsers shall confirm with the recipient that the package is received in an undamaged/unacessed state.\nWhen receiving physical media, users shall ensure that they are available to sign for the package wherever possible. Where this is not possible, users must nominate another user to sign, and must ensure that the user knows how to secure the package. Packages containing physical data must not be left unattended in reception, or other common areas.\n1.2  Protecting Data From Loss\n\nEven where users adhere to the handling requirements set out in the table above, the daily use, coping, and sharing of information may result in unintended loss, or data leakage. To minimise the likelihood of data leakage, the following policies shall apply:\n\nUsers shall not take photos or screenshots of sensitive or confidential information. Where the photo or screenshot is saved to the device, it may be stored in an un-secure location, and accessible to unauthorised users.\nUsers shall regularly review and purge temporary file locations, such as the \"Downloads\" folder, draft document locations, operating system recycle bins, and other trash functions. Files created and downloaded for temporary use may contain sensitive or confidential data, and remain stored in unsecured locations indefinitely, increasing the risk of unauthorised access and data breach.\nUsers shall not use auto-completion of email addresses when sending emails. Where auto-completion of email addresses is used, this can result in the wrong email address being selected, and sensitive or confidential information being sent to unintended recipients. Users should either copy and paste, or fully type out, the correct email address when it is necessary to send sensitive or confidential information via email. Sensitive or confidential information shall always be secured in line with section 1.1.1 of this policy when emailed.\n2.    Securing Working Environments\n\nWhether in the office or at home, physical security measures are essential for ensuring that our users, information, and information assets are protected at all times. This section sets out our requirements for physical security.\n\n2.1  Security in the Office\n\nWhen working from our designated offices or warehouses, the following policies shall apply:\n\nUsers that are issued with keys or access fobs will not lend or transfer them to any other member of staff without prior authorisation.\nUsers must report the loss of any keys or access fobs immediately.\nUsers must ensure any company offices or warehouses are secured before departure and Users must inform management if, for any reason, they are unable to secure the premises.\nUsers shall ensure that all site visitors are accompanied by a staff member.\nUsers shall not allow tailgating into the office i.e. users shall not allow anyone who does not have their own key or access fob to follow them into controlled office areas. The person may not be approved to enter our office area/s, and may pose a risk to other users and/or our assets.\nWhen a user notices an unauthorised person, or unaccompanied guest, in our office area/s, they should approach them only if they consider it safe to do so. In this case, the user shall escort the person back to reception. In a situation where it may be unsafe to challenge the person, users shall alert security staff and/or colleagues, and ensure the person remains in sight until assistance arrives.\nWhere PIN codes are used for access, users shall not write down their PINs, or communicate their PINs to other users. Where PIN codes are needed, these shall be provided to users during their induction period and shall not be shared.\nUsers working in secure areas shall not leave the secure area unlocked when they are not present.\nWhere maintenance is required in secure areas, users working in secure areas shall ensure that the work taking place is monitored at all times.\nWhen receiving deliveries at a loading area or service access area, the user receiving the delivery shall ensure that delivery or service personnel are monitored at all times until the delivery is complete. The user shall ensure that the delivery is then appropriately secured.\n2.2  Security at Home\n\nWhen working from home, users should follow this set of recommendations:\n\nUsers should not leave guests, builders, or service engineers unattended in the designated home office area. Where this is unavoidable, users should observe strict clean desk and clear screen policies as set out in section below, and should not leave mobile phones or other easily removable devices in plain view.\nUsers should instruct family members or housemates who may share the space to not leave guests, builders, or service engineers unattended in the designated home office area.\nUsers should ensure work-related deliveries are not left in shared areas where they may be inadvertently opened.\n2.3  Security in Public or Shared Spaces\n\nWhen working in public areas, or other shared spaces such as co-working environments, it can be more difficult to implement physical security measures than in a home environment. The following policies apply for working in public and shared spaces:\n\n Users shall ensure that they are familiar with, and abide by, the physical security policies of any co-working spaces that they may use while carrying out work on behalf of our organisation. This may include being issued with a unique ID badge for authorised access to work spaces and facilities, reception sign-in, secure check-in, adherence to safety instructions and drills, etc.\nWhere there is a lack of physical security controls in a co-working space, or the controls contradict the requirements set out for office security in section above, users shall adhere to the requirements of this section wherever possible. This will ensure a minimum level of physical security is applied, no matter where the user may be required to work from.\nUsers shall immediately raise any concerns regarding the security of their physical working environment with their line manager. Concerns may include, but not be limited to:\nNo facility to securely receive work-related deliveries\nOther users of the space sharing authentication mechanisms such as PIN codes, ID badges, fobs, etc.\nNo facilities for secure document disposal such as lockable waste bins or document shredders No facility to print documents securely such as personal printers or authenticated print release No facilities to secure equipment or belongings such as lockers or lockable drawers\nNo perimeter security for the building or work space\nLack of appropriate health and safety mechanisms that may make the space unsafe to work in \nWhen working in more public environments such as a hotel, conference centre, public transport, etc., it may not be possible to apply necessary physical security measures. In this case, users shall adhere to section 3 of this policy, and shall ensure they appropriately protect all information assets they may be using while travelling or working outside of the office or home.\nWhere there is a lack of suitable privacy in any public environment a user may be working in, users shall not conduct confidential calls or meetings related to their work. Users shall wait until a suitable level of privacy is available, or alternatively issue required communications via a secure channel, such as company email.\n3.    Using Information Assets\n\nOur organisation provides approved applications and services to users so that they can carry out their work-related duties. The applications and services are our information assets, and this section sets out the policies for using those assets appropriately.\n\n3.1  Monitoring\n\nTo ensure that our information and information assets are accessed and used in a secure way that minimises any information security risks, and that we meet our legal and regulatory requirements, our organisation retains the right to carry out monitoring of employee devices and company services. These monitoring activities are not productivity monitoring activities, and any examination of user account activity shall be done only with appropriate management and/or HR approval. \n\nIn order to carry out monitoring activities, we may:\n\nConfigure alerting or activity reporting on services provided to users\nStore and review logs or other data generated from monitoring activities\nRequest ad hock endpoint security checks on employee devices\n\nUsers shall comply with our monitoring activities as follows:\n\nUsers should strictly comply with the company BYOD policy and not attempt to remove or tamper with the prescribed configurations (as per the Endpoint Security Review checklist)\nUsers shall not attempt to disable or bypass settings that facilitate monitoring, such as proxy server or web- filtering settings.\nUsers shall use only the user account assigned to them when using our services unless authorised to use service.\nAdministrators of services shall not attempt to alter or temper any logging data that may be stored.\n3.2  Securing Equipment & Records\n\nWhile using equipment and services, the following policies shall apply:\n\nUsers shall not leave equipment such as laptops and mobile phones unattended in communal office areas such as meeting rooms, toilets, kitchens, reception, etc.\nWhen leaving laptops unattended in unsecured areas is unavoidable, users shall use the security cables provided to secure laptops to desks, meeting room tables, etc.\nUsers shall adhere to the clear desk and clear screen principle, by ensuring the following whenever they step away from the desk: \nThat all work-related documents and mobile devices are placed in drawers or secured in lockable cabinets\nThat their computer or laptop is locked and cannot be viewed or accessed by any other person\nUsers shall ensure any paper records are secured in designated filing areas or secure filing cabinets. When working from home, users should keep printing to a minimum, and should not leave work-related documents in general areas.\nUsers shall ensure that any printed records not required for filing shall be disposed of in the secure recycling bins provided. When working from home, users requiring document disposal shall contact their line manager to discuss providing either collection services, or separate shredding facilities.\n3.3  Using Equipment\n\nOur organisation mandates the use of personal devices for company use. This is typically known as a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy. The use of personal devices is risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process, and may not be permitted in some situations, such as with users responsible for processing highly confidential information. The use of personal devices is subject to annual endpoint security reviews.\n\nThe following section sets our general security requirements for using both company(if applicable) and personal equipment.\n\n3.3.1   Company equipment\n\nWhen using company computers, laptops, or mobile phones, the following policies apply:\n\nUsers shall not log into, or attempt to log into, company equipment that is not assigned to them. \nUsers shall not install unapproved applications or software.\nUsers shall not connect unapproved removable media such as USBs, external hard-drives, and mobile phones.\nUsers shall not insert, or run applications from, removable media such as CDs and DVDs.\nUsers shall not transfer data from their company equipment to any removable media unless approved by their line manager and IT.\nUsers shall not tamper with, or disable, any anti-virus and/or anti-malware applications installed. Users shall not tamper with, or disable, any firewall applications installed.\nUsers shall not tamper with, or disable, any MDM software installed.\nUsers shall not tamper with, or disable, any web-filtering applications installed.\nUsers shall not tamper with, or disable, any VPN software installed, and shall ensure that it is used when connecting to office services and network drives, etc.\nUsers shall use only the provided applications to edit and store data. For example, company network drives and folders, Microsoft 365, OneDrive, Upscaler, etc. Information stored locally on the device may be lost if the computer fails, mobile is stolen, etc.\nUsers shall not attempt to log onto company equipment with a user account that does not belong to them.\nUsers shall not take or remove company equipment unless approved. For example, where provided with a desktop computer, a user shall not take the computer home unless authorised to do so by their line manager and IT.\nUsers shall ensure that reasonable precautions are taken when carrying or transporting company equipment outside of the office. For example, laptops should be locked in the boot of the car while unattended, laptops should not be left unattended while on public transport, etc.\nUsers shall notify their line manager and IT immediately if any device is lost or stolen. \nUsers shall not disable security update applications.\n3.3.2   Personal equipment\n\nWhen using personal computers, laptops, or mobile phones, the following policies apply:\n\nUsers shall ensure that they install anti-virus on their personal laptop, desktop, and/or mobile phone. Where the user does not have anti-virus software, they should contact their line manager, and it can be provided, where required.\nUsers shall use only the provided web-based applications to edit and store data. For example, Google Drive, Zoho, Microsoft 365, OneDrive, Upscaler, etc. Information stored locally on the device may be lost if the computer fails or is breached, mobile is stolen, etc.\nUsers shall ensure that reasonable precautions are taken when carrying or transporting equipment. For example, laptops should be locked in the boot of the car while unattended, laptops should not be left unattended while on public transport, etc.\nUsers shall ensure their mobile phones are secured with at least a PIN.\nUsers shall notify their line manager and IT immediately if any personal devices used to access our services and information is lost or stolen.\nWhere users have accepted the installation of VPN software, they shall not tamper with, or disable it. Where VPN software is available, users shall always connect to office services using the VPN, and shall disable the VPN as soon as their session is complete.\nWhere available, users should always use 2FA for accessing company services from personal devices, and shall always log out from the service once their session is complete.\n\nFurther Guidelines on required security measures are provided in Evercam BYOD Policy.\n\n3.4  Returning Equipment & Records\n\nWhen leaving the organisation or completing a contract for services, the following policies apply:\n\nUsers shall return all company laptops, computers, paper records, and mobile phones on departure from the organisation\nWhere personal devices have been used, users shall ensure that they have logged off of all company services such as Microsoft 365, OneDrive, VPNs, etc.\nUsers shall ensure that any company information that may have been stored locally on personal devices is transferred to company services and/or networks, and is deleted permanently from the device.\nWhere working from home, users shall contact their line manager to discuss providing either collection services, or separate shredding facilities for paper records.\n3.5  Using the Internet\n\nAcceptable use of internet service is set out in Evercam [Company Manual.](https://company man) Policies governing the secure use of internet services provided by users working from home, or at remote working sites should adhere to these recommendations, that should not be considered exhaustive:\n\nUsers working from home and using wi-fi should carry out the below steps to ensure that their home network is reasonably secure:\n\nChange the default SSID to something that does not identify the modem, provider, or network location\nEnable WPA2\nSet a strong network password; default passwords should be changed immediately\nDo not provide the network password to guests, builders, or service engineers; where this is absolutely necessary, the password should be changed immediately after they no longer require access \nWhen using cabled internet, users working from home should ensure that the cabling from their equipment to the modem does not run outside of the home in a way that could be tampered with or damaged.\nUsers should avoid using open, unsecured wi-fi hotspots as they are frequently exploited by malicious attackers.\nUsers should avoid connecting to wi-fi networks that request personal data and/or login credentials to access the service. These may be attempts to steal data.\nWhere in any doubt, users should use the tethering facility on their mobile phone for internet access. \n3.6  Using Email\n\nAcceptable use of our email service is set out in our [Company Manual.](https://company man) Policies governing the secure use of personal email while working from home on personal devices is outside the scope of this document. The following is a set of recommendations for users working from home and using their own equipment:\n\nUsers should be careful not to use their work email when placing personal online orders. This will assist in identifying malicious email campaigns that try to exploit expected package delivery to steal login credentials.\nWhere not enforced, users should always use 2FA for accessing company email services from personal devices.\nUsers should be careful to always check which email they are using before sending any work-related email as they may inadvertently be in their personal email.\nUsers should avoid using auto-complete when selecting recipient email addresses, and check the recipient address is correct before sending any work-related email.\nUsers shall be careful of any email asking for confirmation of login credentials; as a rule users should not click on email links unless they have just requested a password reset and the email has been received as part of the reset process.\n3.7  Using Company Social Media\n\nAcceptable use of social media services is set out in our Social Media Policy. Policies governing the secure use of personal social media while working from home on personal devices is outside the scope of this document. Users working from home and using their own equipment should keep the following in mind when using social media services: \n\nUsers should be careful to always check which social media profile they are using before posting any work-related communications or content as they may inadvertently be in their own personal social media profile.\nWherever possible, users should always use 2FA for accessing company social media services from personal devices.\n4.    Controlling Access to Information Assets\n\nOur organisation uses various authentication information such as passwords, security tokens, 2FA, and PIN codes to authenticate our users, and to secure our services and equipment from unauthorised use. The following policies apply for securing authentication information:\n\nUsers shall not write down, or share their login credentials or PIN codes with anyone; IT and colleagues should never ask for login credentials, and a request for your details might be an attempt to steal them, or bypass anti-fraud measures, etc.\nUsers shall create strong, complex passwords. Strong, complex passwords will typically have: \nA minimum of 8 characters\nA mix of numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and special symbols such as (*%!&)\nUsers shall create passwords that are not easily guessed. Passwords that include the names of friends, family, children, pets, birth dates, etc. are easily guessed and may be brute-forced by a malicious attacker. Examples of passwords that are easily guessed will typically have a combination of:\nMonth Day Year e.g. January0120!, February2012*, etc.\nName Birthday e.g. JohnSmith2390! \nUsers shall always use a unique password for each service and account used, regardless of whether it is a personal or company account. If a personal social media account or other personal web-based service account is compromised, malicious persons might gain unauthorised access to company services, or vice versa.\nWhere personal devices are used to access company services, users shall not share their login credentials or PIN codes with family members, or allow family members to use the devices.\nUsers shall use 2FA for accessing company services, wherever possible. Users shall not tamper with or remove security tokens.\n5.    Identifying & Reporting Incidents\n\nWhile performing work-related activities, a situation may arise where a user suspects that a security incident has taken place. Users may notice some of the following:\n\nSuspicious emails such as replies to emails they didn't send, phishing emails, large numbers of spam emails, multiple password reset request emails, etc.\nPop-ups, notifications, or web-pages that they do not recognise Sudden slowness of their device and inability to use company services Malware notifications\nDisconnection from the office network Inability to log into company services\nPersons in office areas that they should not be in Persons without staff badges who are unaccompanied Passwords or PINs written down\nUsers verbally sharing their user credentials, or logging onto each other's devices Confidential documents left at printers\nSecurity doors propped open and unattended Theft of a mobile phone or laptop\nEmail containing confidential data accidentally sent to the wrong person\nReports from customers or other third-parties of unavailability of services, or suspicious activity such as spam\nWhere users suspect that an incident has taken place, the following policy applies:\nUsers shall immediately contact IT and their line manager regarding the suspected incident Users shall provide the following information when reporting the incident: \nName\nDepartment\nContact details\nThe time that they first noticed the issue\nA description of the issue, to the best of their ability\nWhere appropriate, users can take photos of the affected device's screen, or in situations where they have seen doors propped open, where there is evidence of potential theft or break-in, etc. Caution should be used in taking any photos which may display personal data, such as other users in the image, visible personal information on printed documents, etc.\nUsers shall treat the incident as confidential, and shall not discuss the incident with other users unless it is necessary for assisting the incident investigation.\nUsers shall not communicate any detail of the incident on any social media service, or to any external persons or third-parties. Communication of the incident externally is considered a data breach, and will be investigated.

    "title": "Anti-Bribery Policy | Evercam",

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nAnti-Bribery\nPolicy statement \n\nEvercam (including its companies globally, together with the \"Company\") is committed to complying with all laws and regulations which govern our operations in every country in which we operate. This Anti-Bribery Policy (the \"Policy\") explains our individual responsibility to comply with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws around the world and to ensure that any third parties that we engage to act on our behalf, do the same. The penalties for violating these laws can be severe, both for the Company and for the individuals involved, including significant corporate and individual fines, and imprisonment. Evercam has a zero-tolerance attitude towards bribery. Even the suggestion of corruption may damage the reputation of the Company and affect its ability to do business, as well as the reputation of its employees. The Company is therefore committed to doing business ethically, even if this means not gaining new business, not using the services of particular agents or business partners or incurring delays in carrying on our existing business. Any violation of this Policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal in appropriate circumstances. It is therefore extremely important that you familiarise yourself with this Policy and strictly adhere to it. If you have any questions, please consult your Designated Legal/Compliance Officer.  \n\nScope \n\nThe principles and obligations outlined in this Policy apply to all employees of Evercam companies globally, members of Evercam's Board of Directors, and Evercam's contractors (which include agents, consultants, outsourced personnel and other representatives). As such, each of us is responsible for adhering to these standards in our business interactions, and we must ensure that all Company contractors retained by us understand that they are responsible for complying with this Policy when acting on behalf of the Company. This Policy sets forth Evercam minimum compliance standards with respect to interactions with third parties. However, where local law, regulations or local or Business Unit internal policies require more stringent controls, then such more stringent controls must be followed. It is the responsibility of each local market/ Business Unit to identify and strictly adhere to all more stringent local/ Business Unit requirements and controls.   \n\nWhat is a Bribe?  \n\nA bribe means: \n\nThe offering, promising, giving, authorising, requesting or receiving of financial or non-financial advantage or anything of value. \nIf the purpose of the payment is to secure the improper performance of/ misuse of a person's position.  \nProhibition of Bribery \n\nNo person who is subject to this Policy shall:  \n\nOffer, provide, or authorise, a bribe or anything which may be viewed as a bribe either directly or indirectly or otherwise through any third party; or  \nRequest or receive a bribe or anything which may be viewed as a bribe either directly or indirectly or otherwise through any third party, or perform their job functions improperly in anticipation, or in consequence, of a bribe. \n\nThe prohibition on accepting a bribe from, or giving a bribe to, any person applies to any person acting in the course of a business, as an employee of a business or otherwise on behalf of others in relation to their performance of their duties and to public officials. Any dealings with public officials present a particularly high risk. Another high-risk group for contact with Evercam employees and contractors is healthcare professionals (such as doctors, nurses, nutritionists, etc.) specifically those who work in a public setting such as State medical services, hospitals, and other nationalised industries. Even the appearance of improper conduct in the context of public officials would have a significant reputational impact on Evercam's public image. Evercam employees and contractors must take great care in these situations. Under this Policy, public officials include any officer, employee or representative of the government or a government-owned entity. The term will also extend to a legislative, administrative or judicial official, regardless of whether elected or appointed; an officer of, or an individual who holds a position in, a political party; a candidate for political office; or the person who otherwise exercises a public function for or on behalf of any country. This list is not exhaustive so you should consult with your Designated Legal/Compliance Officer if you have any questions or concerns. \n\nFacilitation Payment \n\nFacilitation payments are small unofficial payments to public officials to ensure or speed up the performance of routine or necessary action which is part of the public official's usual responsibilities. These are bribes, regardless of whether they may be a part of the \"way of doing business\" in a particular country. As a representative of the Company, you must not make any facilitation payments unless you or your companions are at personal physical risk if you fail to do so.  \n\nThird Parties \n\nEvercam could be held responsible for the actions of a third party (e.g. distributor, agent, contractor, supplier, joint venture partner) acting on its behalf. As such, care must be taken to ensure that those third parties do not engage or attempt to engage in bribery. All group companies shall:  \n\nEnsure that any new third parties (or third parties whose contracts are being renewed) who provide services on behalf of Evercam contractually agree to abide by the principles set out in our Code of Conduct and this Policy. \nUndertake sufficient due diligence in relation to any proposed acquisition or joint venture to ensure that bribery is unlikely. This may include a search of the database on anti-bribery and sanctions lists and checking for relationships with public officials. \n\nThe results of the due diligence process shall be appropriately documented. Undertake sufficient due diligence (including checking of responses) in relation to the new third party's background, capability and reputation to ensure that bribery is unlikely, where any of the \"red flags\" (see list of Red Flags further below in this Policy) are met. This shall include a search of the database on anti-bribery and sanctions lists, checking for relationships with public officials and documenting the reasons for choosing a particular third party. The results, assessments, and reports of the due diligence process shall be documented and produced on request by the Business owner and Procurement. If the due diligence process raises concerns, you must contact the Legal or Compliance Department immediately. \n\nRepeat due diligence every year for ongoing third-party relationships or those which have not previously been checked but which meet the requirements above.  \nGifts and Hospitality \n\nThe act of exchanging business gifts and receiving corporate hospitality can play an appropriate role in building or maintaining business relationships. However, gifts and hospitality are problematic if they create actual or perceived conflicts of interest, or otherwise appear to influence a business decision. \n\nAccepting gifts, discounts, favours, or services from a current or potential customer, competitor, supplier, or service provider is prohibited if that benefit is a type or amount which has the potential to influence a person's business decision. Functions like procurement and sales or health care personnel must take extra care. More strict requirements might apply and these groups might not be allowed to take or give any gifts or hospitality under certain circumstances or policies and procedures applicable to that group. If you have any questions, please consult your Designated Legal/Compliance Officer.  \n\nGifts are only permitted if they are: \n\nReasonable \nInfrequent \nIn good taste \nUnsolicited \nNot cash or a cash equivalent; and \nnot given with the intent to influence a business decision. \n\nOccasionally, for the purpose of building relationships, you may accept or offer social entertainment or hospitality, such as modest meals or event tickets. However, you must not accept or offer entertainment or hospitality unless the activity:  \n\npermits business or educational discussions at the meal or event (a Company representative must be in attendance at the meal or event) \nis part of a genuine business relationship; \nis not intended and could not be perceived by others to improperly influence business decisions; \nis consistent with industry practices, all applicable laws, and our Company policies and procedures; \nis not excessive in value or quantity, as defined by local procedural documents; and \nwould not embarrass our Company if it was brought to public attention.  \n\nWhere local law, regulations or standards, or local or divisional internal policies {e.g. IFCN policies} apply and require more stringent processes/ controls, then such more stringent processes/ controls must be followed.  \n\nPolitical Donations \n\nAs stated in our Code of Conduct, the Company is not a political organisation. It does not support political parties or contribute funds to groups whose activities are calculated to promote party interests or the election of a specific candidate. In very limited instances, if permitted by local law and regulation and with specific approval from the General Manager, the Company may contribute funds toward organisations or entities that engage in the political process to address an issue that directly affects the Company and its business activity. Any request for approval for such payments and the permission must be documented in writing and the payments properly recorded.   \n\nCharitable contributions \n\nCharitable contributions may only be given to recognized non-profit charitable organisations. All donations must be: \n\ntransparent and properly recorded in our books and records; and \nreceipted or have a letter of acknowledgement from the charity to ensure that the donations receive the proper tax treatment \nbe compliant with local law, regulations or local or Business Unit internal policies  \n\nDonations must not: \n\nbe made to individuals or in cash, or \nbe made at the request of a public official as an inducement to or reward for acting improperly.  \nRecord Keeping \n\nFinancial and non-financial records which Evercam maintains are disclosed to shareholders, regulators, and other stakeholders. Accordingly, these records must be accurate and complete so that the Company can substantiate and justify any transactions with third parties.  \n\nAll persons who are subject to this Policy must declare and record in writing all hospitality and gifts given or received. Evercam introduced an electronic Gift and Entertainment Register whose disclosure form can be accessed on the intranet. All persons who are subject to this Policy with access to the intranet are expected to use it for recording. They must also submit expense claims relating to hospitality, gifts or payments made to third parties promptly and provide justification for this expenditure.  \n\n\"Red Flags\" \n\nThere are a number of issues that should cause us to do some further investigation into whether a particular transaction or relationship may present a potential bribery risk or issue. \n\nAll persons who are subject to this Policy must remain vigilant and attempt to spot any of the scenarios listed below. If you should come across a potential issue of the kind listed below, you should (i) consider whether further investigation and due diligence of your counterparty are necessary; and/or (ii) escalate the matter to your manager and you are Designated Legal/Compliance Officer. Potential issues which call for further vigilance and/or investigation include:  \n\nThe prevalence of bribery in a country that has a nexus with a particular transaction or relationship (the third party is located in such a country or the transaction involves such a country); e.g. according to the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) as evaluated annually by Transparency International. \nPayments of unusually high fees or commissions; \nRequests for cash payments or requests for unexpected payments related to government approvals;\nRequests for payments to different companies or through different countries;\nUndefined or unreported payments to third parties made on Evercam's behalf; \nNo written agreements; \nUnusually close relationships with government officials; \nA refusal to certify compliance with this Policy; or \nPayments without a PO number, where applicable.\n\nn\n\nCreated by: Compliance Manager (ISMS team)\n\nCreation date: 27.08.2021\n\nLast modification date: 13.01.2025\n\nDocument Approver: Chief Financial Officer\n\nBook a demo\nContact\n\n6-7 Granby Row, Dublin 1, Ireland\n+353 1 919 4500\n\n\n\nOther Locations\nIE\nUK\nSG\nAU\nUS\nPL\nConstruction Cameras\nCamera Specs\nProjects\nPricing\nTutorials\nBlog\nResources\nE-books\nCase Studies\nReality Capture\nSitemap\nProductivity\nSoftware Integrations\nProject Management\nMarketing\nA.I. for Construction\nAbout\nTerms & Conditions\nGDPR compliance\nTrust Center\nAbout\nContact Us\nCareers\nTestimonials\nPartners\nBecome An Installer\nFind An Installer\nFeatures\nTime-lapse\nLive View\nRecordings\nGate Report\nX-Ray\nBIM Integration\nDrones in Construction\nProgress Photos\nZoom\nCompare Tool\nMark-up Tool\nGoogle Play\n \nApple Store\n\n \nWhatsApp\n \nGithub\n \nLinkedin\n \nTwitter\n \nFacebook\n \nVimeo\n \nYoutube\n \nInstagram"

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nData Handling & Retention Guidelines\nPurpose \n\nWe have set out how our organisation classifies the information we process, and how users should handle that information, in section 1 of our Information Security Policy. The Information Security Policy is the primary policy we use to communicate our requirements for the secure use of devices, workspaces, and information to all users of our information systems and assets. However, when data is first collected or created, it may not be immediately clear how the data should be classified, or who the owner of the data may be. This may result in information being inadvertently shared, or even deleted where it should be retained, which is of particular concern when processing personal data.\n\nTo minimise the risk of inappropriate collection or sharing, accidental loss or destruction, or unauthorised access in these types of scenarios, our organisation has set out best practice principles to help guide our users in the protection of information throughout its lifecycle.\n\nScope\n\nThis document applies to all information that we process as part of our work-related activities. Where there is overlap between the data classification and handling requirements set out in the Information Security Policy and this document, the Information Security Policy shall take precedence.\n\nAudience\n\nAll employees, contractors, and other relevant third-parties shall understand and follow this document when determining how data should be collected, handled, and retained. For the purposes of this document, instructions directed at employees shall also apply to contractors, and other relevant third-parties, and shall be collectively referred to as \"users\". Where discussing the classification and handling of information, users with overall responsibility for the data shall be referred to as the \"data owner\".\n\nCommunication\n\nThese Data Handling & Retention Guidelines shall be communicated to all employees and agency staff as part of our employee induction programme, and periodically following any changes to the available guidance and compliance requirements. All contractors and other relevant third-parties shall be provided with a copy of this document as part of the process for contracting services, and shall be re-issued with updated versions periodically following any changes to the guidelines.\n\nDisciplinary Process\n\nIt is understood that this document and the guidance set out in it may not cover every scenario that arises, or be applicable to every type of data that we handle. However, employees, contractors, or other relevant third-parties performing activities which clearly disregard the guidelines set out in this document shall be subject to the disciplinary process documented in the Company Manual, or the applicable service contract. \n\nImprovement\n\nManagement are committed to the continual improvement of our Data Handling & Retention Guidelines, and shall review this document on an annual basis, or whenever an independent review reveals a change in legal and/or regulatory requirements. The Management Review shall determine if this policy continues to meet the requirements of our organisation.\n\n \n\nManagement also endeavours to plan our business operations so that our information is not misused, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is done by identifying and assigning separate duties throughout our critical business activities to guard against misuses such as illegal transfers, or other errors in data processing activities, etc. Where a user identifies potential conflicts or misuse of information due to improper planning and assignment of duties, users should raise their concern immediately with their line manager, or the ISMS Manager. \n\n1. Data Handling Principles\n\nTo ensure that the data we process is handled and protected appropriately, it is important for all users and data owners to know and understand best practice principles for data processing. Our organisation uses the data privacy principles set out in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as the core principles for the handling of all information we process, regardless of data type or classification. This section sets out these core principles, and how our organisation expects users and data owners to adhere to them in their day-to-day activities. \n\n1.1 Limit Use of the Data\n\nThis principle is frequently referred to as \"purpose limitation\". Information is usually collected for a purpose, and understanding that purpose will assist in identifying the correct controls for handling and retaining it, such as who should have access to it, where it should be stored, how long it should be kept for, etc. Where information is taken and used for a different purpose than what it was collected for, users could expose the data to risks such as unauthorised access, misuse, or non-compliance with legal or regulatory considerations.\n\nFor personal data, the data can only be used for a different purpose when permitted by law. For example, where customer contact data has been collected for the purpose of providing product support, it would not be compatible or lawful for that contact data to be used in a digital marketing campaign unless the customer provided their explicit consent to do so.\n\nUsers and data owners should always consult with the ISMS Manager and/or Data Protection Lead when considering using data for a purpose other than what it was originally collected for.\n\n1.2 Have a Genuine Reason\n\nProcessing information when there is no defined business case for it can expose our organisation to unnecessary data breaches, or legal and regulatory penalties. Where information is collected simply because it seems like it may be useful at the time, it may result in a lack of defined controls or ownership of the data, and an increased level of risk due to inappropriate storage and/or protection.\n\nFor personal data, processing without an appropriate legal basis is unlawful. For example, an employer would have no legal basis for sharing employee data with a private research organisation studying workforce demographics, even though the data would be legitimately interesting to the private research organisation, and the employer may receive payment for sharing the data. This is because employees would likely have no knowledge of the private research organisation's activities, and the employer would have no lawful reason to share the employee data for the purposes of private research. The employees' information could only be processed lawfully by the private research organisation where the organisation has received explicit consent directly from the employees, or where the employer sufficiently anonymises the data so that it is no longer considered personal data.\n\nThe GDPR currently sets out the following legal bases for the processing of personal data:\n\nConsent\nPerformance of a contract\nLegal obligation\nProtection of vital interests\nPublic interest/exercise of official authority\n\nLegitimate interest\n\nIn addition to the above, there are situations in which lawful processing may take place on the following bases:\n\nFurther processing\nLaw enforcement purposes\n\nWhen initiating and developing projects that involve the collection of information, data owners should always consult with the ISMS Manager and/or Data Protection Lead to ensure there is a valid legal basis or business case for processing the information.\n\n1.3 Use Data Fairly\n\nEven where information has been collected and processed for a genuine reason, the processing activity may produce unfair results, or unfairly or negatively impact individuals. This could expose our organisation to potential reputation damage, or loss of trust, and being legally correct in this instance may not be beneficial.\n\nData owners should always consider the needs and expectations of all interested parties when considering how to use information. In particular, when working on projects that involve the collection and processing of personal data, data owners shall always ensure that:\n\nAny impacts on the rights and freedoms of individuals are fully assessed and justifiable, and that the results of assessments are confirmed with the Data Protection Lead.\nThe information provided to individuals is not misleading, possibly resulting in them being surprised or confused about the processing activity.\n1.4 Be Open & Honest\n\nUnless required to maintain strict confidentiality for certain information processing activities, transparency about why and how we use information creates trust and confidence in our colleagues, customers, business partners, employees, suppliers, and other interested parties. A data owner or user who is not open and honest about what data they are collecting and how they are using it may expose the organisation to unnecessary data breach, legal and regulatory penalties, or even cause harm to individuals. Whether being honest about the applications used, where data is stored, or who it is shared with, data owners and users should ensure they clearly communicate this information to line managers and/or relevant team members so that the data can be appropriately handled and protected.\n\nFor personal data, individuals have the legal right to be informed about the use of their personal data. Data owners shall consult with the Data Protection Lead to ensure that information about the use of personal data is clearly and appropriately communicated to individuals in line with applicable data protection law.\n\n1.5 Only Use What's Necessary\n\nThis principle is known as \"data minimisation\", and supports the principle of data protection by design and by default. Where we don't absolutely need the data to carry out a required task or meet a business objective, then we shouldn't collect it, as limiting what we process automatically minimises our organisation's exposure to data breach, misuse of data, and legal and regulatory penalties. Quite simply, if we don't have it, then we can't lose or expose it.\n\nFor personal data, our organisation is legally obligated to collect only what is absolutely necessary to achieve the objective of the processing activity. For example, where a web-service provider needs only a verified email address and username to authorise a user's access to their application, it would be unnecessary to ask a user for information about their gender, location, address, or age for the purposes of authenticating their account. The additional identity data would not only be irrelevant, with no genuine reason to collect and retain it, but in the event of a data breach, a malicious attacker would have a lot more information about users. This information could then allow a malicious attacker to more effectively target a user for scams, fraud, or possible identity theft.\n\nWhen initiating and developing projects that involve the collection and processing of data, data owners should ensure they only collect and use what they need.\n\n1.6 Keep Data Accurate\n\nWhether using data for research and analysis, or maintaining customer or employee records, data that is inaccurate or out of date can negatively impact business decisions and operational activities, as well as our employees, customers, suppliers, and other interested parties. In the case of personal data, individuals have a legal right to expect their personal information to be kept accurate and available. This means that data owners should identify and document appropriate procedures for maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the information used, and ensure they are clearly communicated to users who may work with the data. Users should ensure they adhere to the procedures, and appropriately maintain the accuracy of the information they work with.\n\n1.7 Don't Store Data Longer Than Necessary\n\nFrom having to convert data into formats suitable for archiving, to maintaining legacy equipment to be able to retrieve the information, storing data for long periods of time can not only introduce business costs and operational difficulties, but where data is kept for longer than necessary, it also exposes our organisation to increased risk of data breaches, and legal and regulatory penalties. For personal data, our organisation is legally obligated to securely dispose of the data once it has fulfilled its purpose.\n\nUsing the legal, regulatory, and contractual considerations identified in section 1 of the Information Security Policy and our Critical Asset Register, data owners shall identify appropriate retention periods for the data we process, record these periods to section 2 of this document for reference, and ensure appropriate procedures are implemented to delete information when retention periods are met. Where necessary, data owners should also document and communicate data removal procedures to users who may work with the data to ensure continuous compliance with retention requirements.\n\n1.8 Keep Data Safe & Secure\n\nRegardless of whether the information we collect or create has been classified or assigned a data owner, ensuring that it is protected by default will minimise the risk of unauthorised and potentially illegal access, loss, corruption, reproduction, illegal transfer, or destruction. As mentioned earlier in these guidelines, our Information Security Policy is the primary policy we use to communicate our requirements for the secure use of devices, workspaces, and information to all users of our information systems and assets. Data owners and users shall adhere to our Information Security Policy, and treat all information as confidential unless specifically labelled otherwise. This will ensure there is always a minimum level of protection applied to the information we process.\n\n1.8.1 Technically masking data\n\nIn addition to the requirements for proper handling and use of information and information assets as set out in our Information Security Policy, our organisation may be obligated to comply with contractual, legal, or regulatory requirements to technically restrict access to data by using approved techniques to mask it. It may also be necessary to mask data due to the level of risk associated with the inappropriate use or access of the information. Some technical mechanisms that can be used to mask data may include, but are not limited to:\n\nEncryption - using an approved encryption standard to encrypt the data. Only persons with permission to access the decryption key can decrypt and view the information.\nSubstitution - using a lookup file to substitute existing information with information that looks similar, but isn't accurate. For example, a credit card number may be substituted with a set of numbers that are in the same format as the credit card number, but are not the actual number of the credit card.\nShuffling - moving data around within the same data field so that the original data isn't immediately identifiable. For example, shuffling the numbers of a credit card number into a different order.\nMasking out - making parts of the information unreadable based on the level of access required. For example, payment systems may mask out all but the last four digits of credit card numbers visible to individuals managing customer accounts, while the system can still access the entire number in order to process payments.\nPseudonymisation - similar to substitution, this is usually used in the context of personal data, and involves replacing some information about a person with pseudonyms or randomised data so that the person can't be directly identified.\nAnonymisation - removing all identifiable information about an individual so that none of the data can be recombined to either directly or indirectly identify them. Where personal data has been completely anonymised, it would no longer be considered personally identifiable information, and may no longer require data masking.\n\nData owners shall use the legal and regulatory considerations identified in section 1 of the Information Security Policy and the Critical Asset Register to identify any requirements to mask data, and work with administrators to ensure appropriate masking techniques are identified and implemented, taking into consideration the policies for access control, network protection, and cryptographic controls set out in the Information Systems Security Policy.\n\n1.8.2 Preventing data leakage\n\nEven where data owners and users adhere to the requirements set out in our Information Security Policy, the daily use, copying, sharing, and transmission of data may result in unintended loss, leakage, or even malicious exfiltration. Where working with sensitive information, it may be necessary to implement additional technical mechanisms to prevent unintended copying and sharing of information. Some technical mechanisms may include, but are not limited to:\n\nTechnically preventing the copying and pasting of sensitive information in databases and other information systems.\nImplementation of network controls such as jump servers, which control and track connections to information systems storing sensitive information.\nEmail data loss prevention (DLP) systems which track and quarantine emails containing sensitive information. Emails containing sensitive information would be held in quarantine until approved for release, where appropriate.\nEndpoint DLP software which monitors the use and storage of information on user devices and other information assets. The software may technically prevent use of removable media, or the moving and saving of data to unapproved locations.\nNetwork DLP solutions which monitor sensitive information being transmitted across a network.\nCloud DLP solutions which monitor and encrypt sensitive information stored and transferred using cloud-based services. These solutions may be configured to block the use of unapproved services, or upload of unencrypted data.\n\nData owners shall determine the risks associated with the loss of the sensitive information, and work with administrators to ensure suitable mechanisms for preventing data leakage are identified and implemented, where appropriate.\n\n1.9 Keep Track of Data\n\nNecessary security controls and retention procedures cannot be applied to data that is not appropriately identified and tracked. For personal data, this is referred to as the principle of \"accountability\", and depending on the size of the organisation and nature of the processing activities, may require the creation and maintenance of records of processing. Failure to keep track of the information we handle may expose our organisation to increased risk of data breaches, and legal and regulatory penalties.\n\nOur organisation keeps track of the information that we handle by identifying, recording, and managing our information assets in line with our ISO 27001-aligned information security management system (ISMS), as documented in our ISMS Manual. The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to these information assets are recorded to our Critical Asset Register, and also used to maintain the legal and regulatory considerations documented in section 1 of our Information Security Policy. Data owners shall ensure the necessary retention periods set out in these legal and regulatory requirements are identified and recorded to section 2 of this document.\n\nWhere changes to existing information assets occur, or where new information assets are identified, data owners shall review and update the below section, as appropriate.\n\n2. Data Retention Requirements\n\nAs mentioned in section 1.7 above, data that we collect and use must only be retained as long as necessary. Data retention requirements may be set out in laws and regulations, determined by our customers in contracts, or even set by data owners based on our organisation's own business requirements.\n\nData owners shall use the applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and other considerations identified in our Critical Asset Register, and section 1 of our Information Security Policy, to identify expected retention periods for the information we process, and document these in the table below.\n\nData Type\tRetention Period\tGuidance\tAssociated Critical Asset\tData Owner\nCompany VAT records\tIndefinite\twww.revenue.ie - IEHMRC - UK IRS - US IRAS - SG ATO - AU\tGoogle Drive Governmental websites\tChief Financial Officer\nCRO filings\tIndefinite\twww.cro.ie\tGovernmental websites\tChief Financial Officer\nCustomer Data\tTerms of Service; Data Processing Agreement \tTerms of Service; GDPR;\tApplication production environmentHetzner, AWS, CRM\tChief Technology Officer and Chief Operations Officer\nEmployee personal information (name, address, date of birth etc.)\t7 years\tGDPR; Local employment laws and regulations; Workplace Relations Commission\tZoho People; Google Drive\tChief People Officer\nPayroll details and Payslips\t7 years\tRevenue, GDPR; Local tax laws and regulations; Workplace Relations Commission\tXero, Gusto, SimplePay, Google DriveNative Teams\tChief Financial Officer\nEmployee working time information and absences (maternity/paternity, sickness, extended leave)\t7 years\tGDPR; Local employment laws and regulations; Workplace Relations Commission\tZoho People, Xero, Revenue online system\tChief People Officer\nCareer progression (roles held, promotions, quarterly reviews, trainings, etc.)\t7 years\tGDPR; Local employment laws and regulations; Workplace Relations Commission\tZoho People, Google Drive\tChief People Officer\nWritten Terms of Employment (documentation relating to employment or offers of employment)\t7 years\tGDPR; Local employment laws and regulations; Workplace Relations Commission\tZoho People, Zoho Sign, Google Drive\tChief People Officer\nESOP\t7 years\tShares Agreement, ESOP Manual\tZoho Sign, Google Drive, Global Shares portal\tChief People Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nRecruitment application forms and interview notes for unsuccessful candidates\t1 year\tGDPR; Local employment laws and regulations; Workplace Relations Commission\tZoho Recruit\tChief People Officer\nSupport Tickets\t3 years\tBusiness requirements of the Sales and Operations teams\tZoho Desk\tDirector of Support\nLeads and prospect information\tTerms of Service; Data Processing Agreement \tFor as long as the data remains relevant or until the individual requests their data to be deleted (subject to consent and privacy laws)\tZoho CRM\tChief Revenue Officer\nCorporate website analytics data\tRetain for a reasonable period to analyse marketing effectiveness and trends.\tGDPR; Business requirements of the sales and marketing teams.\tCorporate website; Zoho analytics\tChief Revenue Officer and Head of Marketing\nCCTV footage from cameras at local offices.\t3 years\tGDPR; HR Manual\tCCTV systems at the local offices\tChief Executive Officer\n\nCreated by: Compliance Manager (ISMS)\n\nCreation date: 24.05.2023\n\nLast modification date:  01.01.2025\n\nDocument approver: Head of Compliance\n\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

It takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person's liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. \n\nAt Evercam, we have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery, and we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships. We also implement and enforce effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains. \n\nWe are also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our approach to tackling modern slavery throughout our supply chains, consistent with our disclosure obligations under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.\n\nThis policy applies to all persons working for us or on our behalf in any capacity, including employees at all levels, directors, officers, agency workers, seconded workers, volunteers, interns, agents, contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives and business partners. \n\nPolicies  \n\nEvercam is committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our business or our supply chains. This Statement affirms its intention to act ethically in our business relationships. \n\nThe following policies and terms of business set down our approach to the identification of modern slavery risks and steps to be taken to prevent slavery and human trafficking in our operations: \n\nWhistleblowing policy - Evercam encourages all its workers, customers and other business partners to report any concerns related to its direct activities or its supply chains.\n\nDignity at Work and Equal Opportunities Policies – These policies set down the actions and behaviours expected of employees when representing and working within Evercam.  \n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Policy - The Company's CSR policy summarises how we manage our environmental impacts and how we work responsibly with suppliers and local communities.  \n\nDue Diligence Processes for Slavery and Human Trafficking - The Company undertakes due diligence when considering taking on new suppliers, and regularly reviews its existing suppliers. We seek to work only with suppliers who demonstrate their compliance with relevant laws and regulations regarding modern slavery.\n\nLegal right to work - Evercam is aware of our legal obligation to check the right to work of all employees before hiring them. This requirement is essential to prevent illegal employment, protect the rights of individuals, and ensure compliance with immigration laws. By conducting thorough checks, Evercam verifies that prospective employees have the necessary authorisation to work in a given country, thereby promoting a lawful and responsible workforce. The verification process typically involves examining original documents and confirming their authenticity with relevant authorities, ensuring a compliant and ethical approach to hiring.\n\nThe above applies to any labour agencies that we might wish to use as well as lower tier subcontractors and their labour agencies. The verification process typically involves checking whether our suppliers have in place policies and procedures to reduce the possibility of people being subject to modern slavery or exploitation. \n\nFinal statement \n\nThis Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement will be regularly reviewed and updated as necessary. The Senior Management Team endorses this policy statement and is fully committed to its implementation. \n\nCreated by: Compliance Manager (ISMS team)\n\nCreation date: 27.08.2021\n\nLast modification date: 21.11.2024\n\nDocument approver: Chief People Officernnn\n\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

    "title": "Supplier Due Diligence Policy | Evercam",

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nSupplier Due Diligence\nPurpose\n\nOur organisation relies on third-party providers to assist us in delivering services, not only to our customers, but also internally. They are crucial to meeting our business objectives, but can also introduce risks to our operational and data processing activities where they do not apply the same level of information security controls, and do not meet our requirements for capacity and availability. To ensure that we minimise risks associated with the use of third-parties, we must establish clearly defined relationships with them by leveraging a due diligence programme that includes SLAs, contracts, and supplier review activities.\n\nManagement is committed to ensuring our relationships with our third-parties are managed in line with our security requirements, and have developed and approved this supplier due diligence policy in line with the ISO 27001 standard for information security, and our organisation's business requirements.\n\nThis document sets out the approved supplier due diligence policy so that it can be clearly communicated to all employees, contractors, and third-parties who have responsibilities for contracting and managing suppliers.\n\nScope\n\nThis policy shall apply to the management of all suppliers that have a role in operating and/or providing services that fall within the scope of our organisation's ISMS. Services could include facilities management, cloud-services, web apps, software development, etc.\n\nAudience\n\nAll employees, contractors, and third-parties who have responsibility for the procurement and management of suppliers and third-party services shall adhere to this Supplier Due Diligence Policy. These include, but are not limited to, the following roles:\n\nSenior management\nManagers\nDepartment heads\nLine managers\nAsset owners\nBusiness owners\nData protection managers\nManaged services providers\n\nFor the purposes of this document, employees, contractors, and third-parties who carry out these roles shall be collectively referred to as \"supplier relationship managers\".\n\nCommunication\n\nThis Supplier Due Diligence Policy shall be communicated to all employees and agency staff as part of the relevant department training programme, and periodically following any changes to the policy. All contractors and third-parties involved in managing suppliers and third-party services on our behalf shall be provided with a copy of this policy as part of the process for contracting services. Contractors and third-parties shall be re-issued with updated versions of this policy periodically, and following any changes.\n\nDisciplinary Process\n\nWhere a supplier relationship manager knowingly engages in a relationship with a third-party in breach of this Supplier Due Diligence Policy, they shall be subject to the disciplinary process documented in the Company Manual, or the applicable service contract. Improvement\n\nManagement is committed to the continual improvement of our Supplier Due Diligence Policy, and shall review this document on an annual basis, or whenever an independent review of our organisation's ISMS reveals a non-conformance or opportunity for improvement. The Management Review shall determine if this policy continues to meet the requirements of our organisation.\n\nManagement also endeavours to plan our business operations so that our procurement and management of services is not misused, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is done by identifying and assigning separate duties and responsibilities to guard against misuses such as fraud, or creating situations where there is a conflict of interest, etc. Where a supplier relationship manager identifies potential conflicts or misuse due to improper planning and assignment of duties, they should raise their concern immediately with their line manager, or the ISMS Manager.\n\nChoosing Suppliers\n\nOur third-party providers frequently become our partners in the delivery of our business services, and supplier selection must therefore be done in a controlled way that minimises potential risks to our information systems and information. Our primary goal is to ensure a relationship of trust with our third-party providers, based on:\n\nClear communication of our requirements from the procurement stage, and throughout the lifetime of the relationship.\nAppropriate and regular review and monitoring, based on the type of services provided and the potential associated risks.\nOpen and collaborative engagement where both parties can communicate potential or ongoing issues that may impact the required services. This section sets out our criteria for selecting suppliers.\nChange Control\n\nThe procurement of a new service, or the change of an existing one, is a change in the way that we operate, and potentially a change to our information systems and the way we process information. Supplier relationship managers shall ensure that all such changes are raised in line with our Change Control Procedure so that change managers can be assigned and properly assess the proposed new supplier, or change in service, and determine whether there is a clear business case, and how our organisation's security and business requirements will be met. The following shall be considered when assessing the change:\n\nThe supplier's ability to adhere to our information security policies.\nThe supplier's ability to deliver the service in line with relevant SLAs, including current and projected potential capacity requirements, where relevant.\nThe supplier's reliance on sub-processing or fourth-parties to deliver the service.\nOur existing contractual requirements, and the impact this change in supplier or provision of services may have on our ability to meet those requirements. Our legal and regulatory requirements, and the impact this change in supplier or provision of services may have on our ability to meet those requirements.\nWhat monitoring and review activities will be required to ensure that the third-party continues to meet our security and business requirements. This should be appropriate to the level of risk assigned to the operational and processing activities carried out.\nProcurement\n\nWhere there is an established procurement process in their area, supplier relationship managers shall ensure that the process is followed when engaging with a new contract for services, or amending an existing contract. All procurement processes involving third-party providers shall adhere to the security and business requirements set out in this document.\n\nInformation Security in Agreements\n\nTo ensure our requirements for information security and availability are clearly communicated, each supplier relationship shall be governed by an applicable supplier agreement. The level of controls identified for each agreement shall be appropriate to the level of risk associated with the service and/or processing activities that the third-party provider will be carrying out on our behalf.\n\nOnce the new or modified service and supplier has been assessed in line with our Change Control Procedure as required in section 1.1 of this document, supplier relationship managers shall ensure applicable controls are included in the agreement. This section sets out our required controls for supplier agreements. The controls documented below should not be considered exhaustive, and supplier relationship managers may identify other applicable controls.\n\nCommunication\n\nAll third-party providers must identify a nominated security contact in the supplier agreement. This will not only allow supplier relationship managers to quickly and easily raise security-related concerns to the supplier, but will facilitate the planning and scheduling of monitoring and review activities.\n\nInformation Security Policies & Procedures\n\nSupplier relationship managers shall ensure that all relevant and current information security policies and procedures are provided to third-party providers as part of the process for contracting services, and shall ensure that these are re-issued periodically, and following any changes. All provided information security policies and procedures shall be listed in the agreement, along with their date of issue. This will allow supplier relationship managers to quickly identify which documents have been provided, and if they are current. Third-party providers shall be required to acknowledge receipt of the documents in writing. Where third-parties have determined that they will adhere to their own information security policies and procedures, the third-party shall identify and provide their own corresponding documents. This will allow supplier relationship managers to identify any gaps or issues in policy alignment, and determine documentation for review as part of any monitoring and review activities.\n\nPersonal Data Protection Requirements\n\nThe Data Protection Lead shall be consulted in line with our Change Control Procedure to ensure that all personal data processing requirements are identified. Where the third-party is processing personal data on behalf of our organisation, a contract for data processing shall be put in place that adheres to the applicable data protection laws. No personal data shall be transferred or processed without an agreement in place. Third-parties shall identify a Data Protection Officer or a Data Protection Manager in the agreement so that supplier relationship managers can quickly and easily escalate data processing queries such as personal data requests and potential personal data breach incidents, etc.\n\nLegal & Regulatory Requirements\n\nLegal and regulatory requirements that apply to the service or information processing activities being provided by the third-party may vary depending on the location, type of services being provided, and type of data being processed. For example, where card payment information is being processed, there may be a requirement for the third-party to comply with PCI-DSS. The following policies shall apply: Supplier relationship managers shall ensure that all supplier agreements are reviewed from a legal and regulatory perspective prior to being issued to the third-party provider. Supplier relationship managers shall ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are documented in the agreement. Third-party providers shall be required to acknowledge adherence to the applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Supplier relationship managers shall review agreements they are responsible for at regular intervals, and ensure the legal and regulatory requirements are reviewed and agreed with the third-party, as required.\n\nIntellectual Property & Escrow\n\nSupplier relationship managers shall ensure that ownership for intellectual property is clearly documented in agreements with third-parties. Where necessary, supplier relationship managers shall ensure that provisions for placing source code into escrow are identified and documented in the agreement. Where third-parties provide software development services that may use our own software or code, supplier relationship managers shall ensure that agreements contain controls that prohibit the modification or reverse engineering of our software packages, unless absolutely required to fulfil the contract for services.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nSupplier relationship managers shall ensure that all agreements they are responsible for contain suitable confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). All data transferred to, and/or processed by, third-party providers must be protected from unauthorised disclosure.\n\nFourth-Parties & Supply Chain\n\nThird-party providers shall identify all fourth-parties they engage with for sub-processing and/or service delivery activities in agreements. Sub-contracted organisations can impact the supply chain, and the third-party provider's ability to deliver the services required. Third-party providers shall acknowledge their responsibility for managing relevant fourth-parties in agreements. Third-party providers shall acknowledge that all applicable information security policies and procedures are communicated to fourth-parties.\n\nRight to Audit\n\nSupplier relationship managers shall ensure that the right to audit is included in agreements with third-party providers. The right to audit will include the necessary review and monitoring activities identified in line with section 1.1 of this document. Activities include, but may not be limited to:\n\nVulnerability scanning\nPenetration testing\nSite visit and physical security audits\nReview of applicable information security policies and procedures at regular intervals\nConfirmation of the validity of any independent certifications held\nEngagement with and completion of required security questionnaires\nProvision and review of the results of any self-testing exercises such as service continuity testing, penetration testing, etc. Security awareness training programmes\nContinuity of Services\n\nSupplier relationship managers shall ensure that the capacity and availability requirements identified in section 1.1 of this policy are documented in the agreement. Third-party providers shall acknowledge the agreed service levels by including an appropriate SLA in the agreement. Where third-party providers may be required to participate in our own business continuity and incident response testing exercises, supplier relationship managers shall ensure the requirement to participate is included in the agreement.\n\nRetention of Third-Party Certification\n\nIn situations where a valid third-party certification has been provided in lieu of performing certain due diligence activities with a third-party provider, the third-party provider shall include the intention to maintain the certification in the agreement, and provide a copy of the most recent certificate.\n\nTraining\n\nThird-party providers shall provide assurance in agreements that the employees they contract to deliver the service are appropriately vetted and trained to perform the required work.\n\nAgreement Termination\n\nSupplier relationship managers shall ensure that grounds for contract termination are included in the agreement. These should be appropriate to the risk level assigned to the service and/or associated information processing activities. Supplier relationship managers shall ensure a suitable duration for the agreement is set. Agreements shall not be valid for excessively long or short periods of time, but should be appropriate to the criticality of the service and assigned risk level. For example, a contract for facilities management may be valid for 3 years, but a contract to use a cloud-based payroll service may be valid for 1 year, and subject to quarterly review. Third-party providers shall acknowledge that all information provided to them by our organisation will be returned upon termination of the agreement, and shall also stipulate how the information will be returned.\n\nReview & Monitoring\n\nAs mentioned in section 1.1 and section 2.8 of this document, appropriate review and monitoring activities should be identified to ensure that the third-party providers we engage with for services continue to meet their contractual obligations and adhere to our requirements for information security and availability. The following policies for review and monitoring of third-party providers shall apply: The review and monitoring activities identified shall be appropriate to the level of risk assigned to the service and associated information processing activities. The review and monitoring activities identified shall not be excessive, and shall be planned in a way that does not disrupt the business operations of either party. Supplier relationship managers shall ensure that review meetings are held at regular intervals with the third-party providers they are responsible for. The frequency of review meetings shall be based on the level of risk assigned to the service and associated information processing activities. Supplier relationship managers shall ensure that all evidence of review and monitoring activities, such as meeting minutes, testing results, updated policies and procedures, security questionnaires, etc. are retained. Reviewing and monitoring activities should be captured using the Supplier Monitoring Activity Review, where appropriate. Supplier relationship managers shall review agreements with third-party providers at least annually to ensure that the agreement continues to meet our business and security requirements. Where potential changes are identified, these shall be raised with the third-party provider and the agreement updated, where possible. Agreement review activities should be captured using the Supplier Agreement Review, where appropriate. Where a change in agreement is required, or a third-party provider can no longer meet the requirements of an agreement, supplier relationship managers shall notify the ISMS Manager so that a risk assessment can be organised and performed in line with our Risk Management Process. Where review and monitoring activities show that a third-party provider is consistently failing to meet the agreed security and business requirements, the supplier relationship manager shall notify the ISMS Manager so that a risk assessment can be organised and performed in line with our Risk Management Process. Where the third-party is a cloud service provider that provides only standard terms and conditions and does not engage with individual monitoring and review activities, the requirements set out in section 4 this policy shall apply.\n\nCloud Services\n\nOur organisation may choose to engage with third-party providers that provide their services as cloud-based SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS solutions. These services are frequently multi-tenant, and provide only subscription-based and/or on-demand agreements based on a standard set of terms and conditions. In these situations it may not be possible to establish individual agreements with the third-party providers which cover all of our information security and business requirements.\n\nThe following policies shall apply when a cloud-service provider does not offer individual agreement for services: The cloud-service provider shall be carefully assessed in line with our Change Control Procedure to determine if the service meets our security and business requirements, ensuring that any gaps are identified. Where the cloud-service provider uses a shared-responsibility model, it is important to understand what the provider is responsible for, and what our organisation is responsible for. For example, AWS provides identity access controls as a service, but it is the customer's responsibility to ensure the controls are implemented and used in line with organisational security policy. The ISMS Manager shall assist in identifying responsibilities and required security controls for the service in line with our Risk Management Process. Supplier relationship managers shall ensure they subscribe to relevant news or update feeds for the cloud-service provider to remain informed of any service updates and changes to terms and conditions. The Data Protection Lead shall ensure that any processing of personal data complies with applicable data protection laws as part of our Change Control Procedure. Data shall not be transferred illegally. Supplier relationship managers shall ensure that all available information related to the security of the cloud service is reviewed, where available. Where third-party certification and audit reports are provided, these shall be reviewed to confirm the validity of the certification, and that the published scope of the certification includes the services provided to our organisation. Supplier relationship managers shall review agreement information, such as terms of service, subscriptions, and data processing agreements (DPAs), at regular intervals in line with section 3 above. Where use of the cloud-service provider is terminated, supplier relationship managers shall ensure that data is appropriately returned, exported, or deleted either prior to termination, or as part of the termination process. Supplier relationship managers shall confirm access to the service is removed following return, export, or deletion of the data.\n\nExisting Suppliers\n\nOur organisation may have engaged with a number of suppliers prior to the implementation of this Supplier Due Diligence Policy, and therefore these existing providers may not be contractually obligated to meet our requirements for information security. In this situation, the following policies shall apply: The third-party provider shall be risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process to identify any gaps in current security controls.

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nAnti-Tax Evasion\nPolicy Statement\n\nIt is our policy to conduct all of our business in an honest and ethical manner. We take a zero-tolerance approach to facilitation of tax evasion, whether under the law of any foreign country. We are committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships wherever we operate and implement and enforce effective systems to counter tax evasion facilitation. We will uphold all laws relevant to countering tax evasion, including the Criminal Finances Act 2017.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to:\n\nset out our responsibilities, and of those working for us, in observing and upholding our position on preventing the criminal facilitation of tax evasion; and\nprovide information and guidance to those working for us on how to recognise and avoid tax evasion.\n\nAs an employer, if we fail to prevent our employees, workers, agents or service providers facilitating tax evasion, we can face criminal sanctions including an unlimited fine, as well as exclusion from tendering for public contracts and damage to our reputation. We therefore take our legal responsibilities seriously.nIn this policy, third party means any individual or organisation you come into contact with during the course of your work for us, and includes actual and potential clients, customers, suppliers, distributors, business contacts, agents, advisers, and government and public bodies, including their advisers, representatives and officials, politicians and political parties. \n\nThis policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.\n\nThe compliance officer is the General Counsel or her nominee.\n\nWho Must Comply with this Policy?\n\nThis policy applies to all persons working for us or any Group Company or on our behalf in any capacity, including employees at all levels, directors, officers, agency workers, seconded workers, volunteers, interns, agents, contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives and business partners, sponsors, or any other person associated with us, wherever located.\n\nWho is Responsible for the Policy?\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for ensuring this policy complies with our legal and ethical obligations, and that all those under our control comply with it. The compliance officer has primary and day-to-day responsibility for implementing this policy, monitoring its use and effectiveness, dealing with any queries about it, and auditing internal control systems and procedures to ensure they are effective in preventing the facilitation of tax evasion. Management at all levels are responsible for ensuring those reporting to them understand and comply with this policy and are given adequate and regular training on it. You are invited to comment on this policy and suggest ways in which it might be improved. Comments, suggestions and queries should be addressed to the compliance officer.\n\nWhat is Tax Evasion Facilitation?\n\nFor the purposes of this policy:\n\nTax evasion means the offence of cheating the public revenue or fraudulently evading tax, and is a criminal offence. The offence requires an element of fraud, which means there must be deliberate action, or omission with dishonest intent;\nForeign tax evasion means evading tax in a foreign country, provided that conduct is an offence in that country and would be a criminal offence if committed. As with tax evasion, the element of fraud means there must be deliberate action, or omission with dishonest intent; and\nTax evasion facilitation means being knowingly concerned in, or taking steps with a view to, the fraudulent evasion of tax (whether UK tax or tax in a foreign \n\n(country) by another person, or aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of that offence. Tax evasion facilitation is a criminal offence, where it is done deliberately and dishonestly.n\n\nUnder the Criminal Finances Act 2017, a separate criminal offence is automatically committed by a corporate entity or partnership where the tax evasion is facilitated by a person acting in the capacity of an \"associated person\" to that body. For the offence to be made out, the associated person must deliberately and dishonestly take action to facilitate the tax evasion by the taxpayer. If the associated person accidentally, ignorantly, or negligently facilitates the tax evasion, then the corporate offence will not have been committed. The company does not have to have deliberately or dishonestly facilitated the tax evasion itself; the fact that the associated person has done so creates the liability for the company.\n\nTax evasion is not the same as tax avoidance or tax planning. Tax evasion involves deliberate and dishonest conduct. Tax avoidance is not illegal and involves taking steps, within the law, to minimise tax payable (or maximise tax reliefs).\n\nIn this policy, all references to tax include national insurance contributions and their equivalent in local jurisdictions.\n\nWhat You Must Not Do\n\nIt is not acceptable for you (or someone on your behalf) to:\n\nengage in any form of facilitating tax evasion or foreign tax evasion;\naid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of a tax evasion offence or foreign tax evasion offence by another person;\nfail to promptly report any request or demand from any third party to facilitate the fraudulent evasion of tax, or any suspected fraudulent evasion of tax by another person, in accordance with this policy;\nengage in any other activity that might lead to a breach of this policy; or\nthreaten or retaliate against another individual who has refused to commit a tax evasion offence or a foreign tax evasion offence or who has raised concerns under this policy.\nYour Responsibilities\n\nYou must ensure that you read, understand and comply with this policy. The prevention, detection and reporting of tax evasion and foreign tax evasion are the responsibility of all those working for us or under our control. You are required to avoid any activity that might lead to, or suggest, a breach of this policy.\n\nYou must notify your line manager and/or the compliance officer as soon as possible if you believe or suspect that a conflict with this policy has occurred, or may occur in the future. For example, if an employee or supplier asks to be paid into an offshore bank account, without good reason, or a supplier asks to be paid in cash, indicating that this will mean the payment is not subject to VAT. Further \"red flags\" that may indicate potential tax evasion or foreign tax evasion are set out in clause 12.\n\nHow to Raise a Concern\n\nYou are encouraged to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion of tax evasion or foreign tax evasion at the earliest possible stage.\n\nIf you become aware of any fraudulent evasion of tax (whether UK tax or tax in a foreign country) by another person in the course of your work, or you are asked to assist another person in their fraudulent evasion of tax (whether directly or indirectly), or if you believe or suspect that any fraudulent evasion of tax has occurred or may occur, whether in respect to UK tax or tax in a foreign country, you must notify your line manager and/or the compliance officer as soon as possible.\n\nIf you are unsure about whether a particular act constitutes tax evasion or foreign tax evasion, raise it with your line manager and/or the compliance officer as soon as possible. You should note that the corporate offence is only committed where you deliberately and dishonestly take action to facilitate tax evasion or foreign tax evasion. If you do not take any such action, then the offence will not be made out. However, a deliberate failure to report suspected tax evasion or foreign tax evasion, or \"turning a blind eye\" to suspicious activity could amount to criminal facilitation of tax evasion.\n\nProtection\n\nIndividuals who raise concerns or report another's wrongdoing, are sometimes worried about possible repercussions. We aim to encourage openness and will support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken.\n\nWe are committed to ensuring no one suffers any detrimental treatment as a result of:\n\nrefusing to take part in, be concerned in, or facilitate tax evasion or foreign tax evasion by another person;\nrefusing to aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of a tax evasion offence or a foreign tax evasion offence by another person; or\nreporting in good faith their suspicion that an actual or potential tax evasion offence or foreign tax evasion offence has taken place, or may take place in the future.\nDetrimental treatment includes dismissal, disciplinary action, threats or other unfavourable treatment connected with raising a concern. If you believe that you have suffered any such treatment, you should inform the compliance officer immediately. If the matter is not remedied, and you are an employee, you should raise it formally using our Grievance Procedure.\nTraining and Communication\n\nTraining on this policy forms part of the induction process for all individuals who work for us, and regular training will be provided as necessary. Such training may form part of wider financial crime detection and prevention training.\n\nOur zero-tolerance approach to tax evasion and foreign tax evasion must be communicated to all suppliers, contractors and business partners at the outset of our business relationship with them and as appropriate after that.\n\nBreaches of this Policy\n\nAny employee who breaches this policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal for misconduct or gross misconduct.\n\nWe may terminate our relationship with other individuals and organisations working on our behalf if they breach this policy.\n\nPotential Risk Scenarios: \"Red Flags\"\n\nThe following is a list of possible red flags that may arise during the course of you working for us and which may raise concerns related to tax evasion or foreign tax evasion. The list is not intended to be exhaustive and is for illustrative purposes only.n\n\nIf you encounter any of these red flags while working for us, you must report them promptly to your line manager and/or the compliance officer:\n\nyou become aware, in the course of your work, that a third party has made or intends to make a false statement relating to tax, has failed to disclose income or gains to, or to register with, HMRC (or the equivalent authority in any relevant non-UK jurisdiction), has delivered or intends to deliver a false document relating to tax, or has set up or intends to set up a structure to try to hide income, gains or assets from a tax authority;\nyou become aware, in the course of your work, that a third party has deliberately failed to register for VAT (or the equivalent tax in any relevant non-UK jurisdiction) or failed to account for VAT;\na third party requests payment in cash and/or refuses to sign a formal commission or fee agreement, or to provide an invoice or receipt for a payment made;\nyou become aware, in the course of your work, that a third party working for us as an employee asks to be treated as a self-employed contractor, but without any material changes to their working conditions;\na supplier or other subcontractor is paid gross when they should have been paid net, under a scheme such as the Construction Industry Scheme;\na third party requests that payment is made to a country or geographic location different from where the third party resides or conducts business;\na third party to whom we have provided services requests that their invoice is addressed to a different entity, where we did not provide services to such entity directly;\na third party to whom we have provided services asks us to change the description of services rendered on an invoice in a way that seems designed to obscure the nature of the services provided;\nyou receive an invoice from a third party that appears to be non-standard or customised;\na third party insists on the use of side letters or refuses to put terms agreed in writing or asks for contracts or other documentation to be backdated;\nyou notice that we have been invoiced for a commission or fee payment that appears too large or too small, given the service stated to have been provided;\na third party requests or requires the use of an agent, intermediary, consultant, distributor or supplier that is not typically used by or known to us;\n\nCreated by: Compliance Manager (ISMS team)\n\nCreation date: 27.08.2021\n\nLast modification date: 21.11.2024\n\nDocument approver: Chief Financial Officer\n\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of the IT systems we use ensures that the operations we perform, and the services we provide, continue to meet our business objectives, comply with regulatory and legal requirements, and fulfil the requirements of our stakeholders. It also ensures that any personal data we process about our employees and customers is kept secure, minimising any potential risks or harm that may be caused by a breach of that data. Management are committed to the security of our information, and have developed and approved this information systems security policy in line with the requirements of the international standards for information security, and our organisation's business requirements. This document sets out the approved information systems security policy so that it can be clearly communicated to all employees, contractors, and third-parties who have responsibilities for developing, managing, and maintaining our IT systems.\n\nScope\n\nThis policy shall apply to the development, administration, and acquisition of all IT systems that fall within the scope of our organisation's ISMS.\n\nAudience\n\nAll employees, contractors, and third-parties who have responsibility for the design, development, administration, acquisition, and monitoring of our information systems shall adhere to this Information Systems Security Policy. These include, but are not limited to, the following roles:\n\nSystem Administrators\nNetwork Engineers\nIT Support\nIT Services Providers\nCloud Services Providers\nCloud Security Architects\nSystem Architects\nSystem Developers\nInformation Security Analysts\nSystem Owners\nSystem Testers\n\nFor the purposes of this document, employees, contractors, and third-parties who carry out these roles shall be collectively referred to as \"administrators\".\n\nCommunication\n\nThis Information Systems Security Policy shall be communicated to all employees and agency staff as part of the relevant department training programme, and periodically following any changes to the policy. All contractors and third-parties providing IT services or involved in projects which require connection to our IT systems shall be provided with a copy of this policy as part of the process for contracting services. Contractors and third-parties shall be re-issued with updated versions of this policy periodically, and following any changes.\n\nDisciplinary Process\n\nWhere an administrator performs an activity or activities in breach of this Information Systems Security Policy, they shall be subject to the disciplinary process documented in the Company Manual, or the applicable service contract.\n\nImprovement\n\nManagement is committed to the continual improvement of our Information Systems Security Policy, and shall review this document on an annual basis, or whenever an independent review of our organisation's ISMS reveals a non-conformance or opportunity for improvement. The Management Review shall determine if this policy continues to meet the requirements of our organisation.\n\nManagement also endeavours to plan our business operations so that our IT systems are not misused, either intentionally or unintentionally. This is done by identifying and assigning separate duties and responsibilities to guard against misuses such as fraud, or malicious insider activities, etc. Where an administrator identifies potential conflicts or misuse of information systems due to improper planning and assignment of duties, administrators should raise their concern immediately with their line manager, or the ISMS Manager.\n\nMaintaining Security Awareness\n\nNew threats and vulnerabilities to technologies and services emerge on a daily basis. To ensure that the potential impact of these information security risks is minimised, administrators must remain informed of any threats and vulnerabilities that may affect the services we provide, and the information systems that we use. This will allow security best practice, vulnerability, and threat management to be key elements of how we manage risk. To maintain awareness of emerging threats and vulnerabilities, the following policies apply:\n\nAdministrators shall subscribe to relevant threat intelligence and vulnerability information sources such as security alert feeds, blogs, or forums such as (for example):\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cve/data_feeds.html\nhttps://isc.sans.edu/ https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/bulletins\nhttps://www.cisecurity.org/cybersecurity-threats\nAdministrators shall regularly review security alert notifications and other threat intelligence sources to determine if any identified vulnerabilities or issues impact our information systems, services, or how we operate them. Administrators shall ensure that they attend security training provided to them to keep their skill-set up-to-date.\nAdministrators should retain evidence of any training received, such as certificates of attendance, certificates of completion, etc., where these are not already retained by HR as part of their employee training programme. Administrators shall maintain regular contact with service and technology providers to ensure that they are kept up-to-date with any vulnerabilities or issues that may arise.\nAnalysing Threats\n\nMaintaining awareness of threats and security issues that may impact our organisation and information assets is only useful if the information is appropriately analysed and actioned as part of a threat intelligence process or lifecycle. Threat intelligence, whether gathered from suitable, trusted sources such as those listed in section above, or developed by our own organisation using tools such as security information and event management (SIEM) systems, is crucial to our ability to identify and respond to new and developing security threats. Threat intelligence can be divided into three main types, with each providing a different layer of information:\n\nStrategic intelligence - high-level, non-technical information about trends in malicious attacks, and the methods and tools attackers are using to launch them. For example, types of malicious attacks and attackers may vary between regions and industries. Where an organisation is expanding into a new region, gathering and assessing strategic threat intelligence would include identifying trends in malicious attacks and attackers in that region. This would allow management to proactively identify necessary resources such as additional security personnel or threat defence systems, before expanding into the new region.\n\nTactical intelligence - detailed practical information about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malicious attackers to exploit weaknesses in an organisation's infrastructure, and attack information systems and assets. For example, information about malicious traffic seen by security experts could help a networking team to configure their organisation's network to block the traffic using methods such as IP blacklisting. The team could also use the information about malicious traffic to check log data for indicators of compromise (IOCs). These activities could even be automated using technology such as next generation firewalls with an intrusion prevention system (IPS).\n\nOperational intelligence - more detailed intelligence about how attacks are initiated, why, and by whom. This helps organisation's to understand which information systems and assets are more likely to be attacked, and how. For example, information issued by security experts about a type of phishing campaign targeting users working in public infrastructure could help a system administrator working in a state body to pre-emptively issue warnings to users about the campaign, and identify which systems are likely to be exploited if there is a successful phishing attempt. This would then allow a response plan to be developed and implemented to inform personnel, and patch or reconfigure vulnerable systems.\n\nWhen analysing and actioning threat intelligence, the following policies shall apply:\n\nThe extent and type of intelligence analysed shall depend on the level of risk associated with the loss or compromise of the information systems and assets, and the requirements of the organisation. Administrators shall ensure that information systems and assets are risked assessed in line with our Risk Management Process\nto identify relevant threats and vulnerabilities, which will assist in identifying sources of threat intelligence such as those suggested in section 1 above.\nWhere necessary, administrators shall identify and implement appropriate tools to log and process threat information. Tools could include, but may not be limited to:\nNetworking tools such as IPS, IDS, web content filtering, etc.\nLog management tools\nVulnerability scanners\nApplication firewalls\nMalware detection systems\nEndpoint detection and response solutions\nSpecialist threat analysis platforms and SIEM systems\nThird-party services such as a security operations centre (SOC) or network operations centre (NOC)\nAdministrators shall identify and document all relevant sources of threat intelligence using our Threat Intelligence Source Review record, including how the information is typically actioned. The information documented shall include, but may not be limited to:\nThe exact source of the information\nWhether the source is internal or external\nWhy the information is necessary\nHow the information will be used by the relevant administrator, team, or department\nThe Critical Assets the information will be used to protect\nThe relevant administrator, team, or department who will use the information\nAny applicable documentation on the use of the information, or procedures used to action the information\nAdministrators shall review the information sources used at planned intervals to ensure they remain accurate and relevant, and that appropriate procedures are in place for the use of the data, such as communicating required actions to users, updating network configuration guides, reporting industry-related threats to management, etc.\nAdministrators shall ensure that any logging or monitoring systems used to collect data for analysis adhere to the policies set out in section 7 of this document. Where an identified threat or vulnerability requires that changes be made to information systems and assets, administrators shall ensure that changes are appropriately controlled in line with section 2 of this document.\nAdministrators shall use threat information gathered to ensure this policy document is kept up-to-date and relevant. For example, this could include adding additional secure disposal methods to section 3.7, or refining hardening controls set out in section 3.6.\nControlling Changes\n\nOur organisation's information systems and services may be impacted by new vulnerabilities, changes in security best practice standards, emerging technologies, impacts to supply chains, introduction of new systems and services, etc. Where required, administrators may need to make or suggest changes to our operating procedures, training requirements, system configurations, etc., and may need to initiate new projects in order to meet our business objectives. When administering our information systems, the following policies shall apply:\n\nAdministrators shall carry out all major changes in line with our Change Control Procedure, including any emergency changes that are raised in order to address discovered or reported security vulnerabilities or weaknesses.\nAdministrators shall inform their line manager or the ISMS Manager of any potential security policy changes so that these can be reviewed.\nAdministrators shall inform their line manager or the ISMS Manager of all new projects that have been raised or initiated so that these can be assessed for any impacts to information security. This will ensure information security requirements are considered when new projects are initiated.\nProtecting Information Systems & Assets\n\nWhile users are required to use our organisation's equipment and services in a secure way, administrators are required to design, develop, administer, and monitor our IT systems and equipment securely, ensuring that any risks to the security of our information are minimised in line with our business objectives. The following section sets out our requirements for IT systems and equipment security.\n\nMaintaining an Asset Inventory\n\nTo ensure all IT systems and equipment are appropriately identified and secured, administrators shall maintain an Equipment Register. The inventory shall include, but may not be limited to:\n\nAsset type i.e. server, firewall, router, switch, laptop, mobile phone, computer, backup tape, etc.\nAsset owner (the person assigned responsibility for the asset, or the primary user of the asset)\nLocation, where relevant\nMake and model, where relevant\nSerial number, or other unique identifier (sometimes vendor dependent), where relevant\nDate of purchase, if known\nDate of destruction, where relevant (see section 3.7)\nFor backup tapes, these should be clearly labelled as required by our disaster recovery procedure\n\nThe Equipment Register shall be reviewed at regular intervals, or when major changes occur, to ensure that it is kept up-to-date and accurate.\n\nInventorying cloud-based assets\n\nWhere assets are predominantly cloud-based, it may not be possible or practical to maintain a full and up-to-date asset list as resources may be spun up or shut down on demand. In this case, the following policies apply:\n\nAdministrators shall implement the appropriate controls to restrict the creation, modification, and deletion of any virtual assets such as virtual servers, cloud containers, storage buckets, virtual networking, virtual services, etc.\nWhere possible, alerting should be implemented to indicate when critical resources are created, modified, or deleted, and these notifications shall:\nBe monitored appropriately to ensure critical assets are not negatively impacted by unplanned modifications\nBe logged and retained in line with data retention requirements for periodic review\nAdministrators shall periodically review cloud-based assets to ensure that all assets used for testing purposes are shut down, decommissioned, or removed, as required.\nAdministrators shall periodically review cloud-based assets to ensure that all assets that have been replaced as part of the maintenance and/or upgrade cycles are shut down, decommissioned, or removed, as required.\nSecuring & Maintaining Equipment\n\nPhysical assets may be physically damaged, tampered with, or removed, resulting in a risk to the security of our IT systems and information. Our physical assets must be appropriately protected from damage in line with our business requirements. The following policies shall apply:\n\nAdministrators shall ensure physical access to critical assets is restricted to only authorised persons. Critical assets would include, but may not be limited to, servers, firewalls, backup tapes, switches, UPS devices, redundant power supplies, modems, etc.\nAdministrators shall ensure that access is removed as soon as it is no longer required.\nAdministrators shall ensure that third-parties requiring access to restricted areas are accompanied at all times.\nSwitch panels which may be attached to walls shall be in lockable cabinets, and the cabinets shall be locked at all times unless maintenance or re-cabling is required. Administrators shall not leave cabinet keys in or near the cabinets.\nEthernet, fibre, critical power, and any other necessary cabling shall not be laid in ways that they can be tampered with or damaged, such as over carpets, exposed on walls, etc. Protective cages and/or covers should be used to ensure no cables are exposed.\nAppropriate environmental controls shall be installed in server and communication rooms to ensure that equipment is not damaged from excessive temperatures and humidity. UPS devices shall be used wherever necessary to ensure power outages do not damage critical assets.\nWhere equipment is installed in server or equipment cages, administrators shall ensure that these are locked at all times unless maintenance, upgrade, or re-cabling is required. Administrators shall not leave cage keys near the cages.\nAdministrators shall ensure any keys or access fobs are kept secure, and that only authorised persons have access to these. Removal of assets for maintenance and/or replacement must be authorised, and must be carried out in line with our policy for transferring physical data in our Information Security Policy.\nMaintenance and/or replacement of assets by third-party providers shall be governed by suitable agreements implemented in line with our Supplier Due Diligence Policy, and shall include the requirement to maintain the confidentiality of any data that may still remain on assets being replaced or repaired.\nWhere assets that are being replaced or decommissioned still store data, administrators shall ensure that they are securely destroyed in line with this policy.\nWhere equipment is co-located in third-party data centres, administrators must adhere to visitor and access policies of the third-party data centres at all times.\nWhere necessary, suitable power generators shall be installed to maintain the required availability of critical assets.\nAll physical assets shall be maintained in line with the recommended maintenance guidance from the vendor or manufacturer. Where there are exceptions identified, such as with legacy systems, this shall be risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process.\nAdministrators shall ensure that suitable maintenance agreements for assets are put in place to support our organisation's availability, performance, capacity, and supply chain requirements.\nAdministrators shall provide suitable security cables to users issued with laptops.\nControlling Malware\n\nMalware is a common tool used to disrupt and destroy information systems, and can include viruses, ransomware, rootkits, spyware, botnets, etc. which may then contribute to other types of malicious attacks, such as DoS and DDoS attacks. Administrators shall implement appropriate controls to prevent malware from infecting and spreading on our IT systems. Administrators shall apply the following policies for controlling malware.\n\nAnti-virus\nWhere possible, regular endpoint security reviews shall be conducted to monitor and manage anti-virus clients installed on all applicable endpoints that are on, or connect to, our company network, including cloud-based infrastructure.\nEndpoints shall include laptops, computers, mobile phones, and servers, whether physical or virtual.\nWhere the anti-virus client cannot be installed or used on an endpoint, such as with unsupported mobile devices, virtual instances and cloud containers, etc. the endpoint shall be risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process\nTo determine the level of risk, and any suitable controls that may remediate the risk, such as file change monitoring, additional server hardening, access control, network segregation, etc. These endpoints shall be identified and assessed separately, as appropriate.\nWhere a centralised antivirus platform is not possible or available, a risk assessment shall be performed in line with our Risk Management Process to determine the level of risk, and any suitable compensating controls.\nAnti-virus clients shall be configured to update regularly from the centralised anti-virus platform, or from the vendor where the anti-virus software is standalone or unmanaged. Anti-virus clients shall be configured to prevent tampering. Where possible, alerting should be implemented on anti-virus software to indicate:\nWhen anti-virus definitions are out-of-date\nWhen potential malicious activity is detected\nWhen the software is tampered with\nWhere alerts cannot be logged and monitored centrally, proper functioning of the anti-virus client shall be verified by administrators at scheduled intervals. The review schedule shall be dependent on the criticality assigned to the endpoint, and administrators shall ensure that any potential malware infections detected are investigated and removed.\nWhere personal devices are used, administrators shall direct users to the Information Security Policy and assist line managers in determining a suitable solution for malware control. Administrators should identify all endpoints which fall under BYOD through regular endpoint security reviews.\nPersonal and host-based firewalls\nWhere possible, personal or host-based firewalls shall be enabled on all applicable endpoints that are on, or connected to, our company network, including cloud-based endpoints.\nEndpoints shall include laptops, computers, and servers, whether physical or virtual.\nEndpoint firewalls shall be configured to prevent tampering.\nWhere possible, alerting should be implemented to indicate:\nWhen potential malicious activity is detected\nWhen the firewall is tampered with\nWhere alerts cannot be logged and monitored centrally, proper functioning of the firewall shall be verified by administrators at scheduled intervals. The review schedule shall be dependent on the criticality assigned to the endpoint, and administrators shall ensure that any potential malicious activity detected is investigated.\nEmail and web filtering\n\nEmail and internet services are frequently used to launch malicious attacks such as phishing and ransomware attacks. Reducing the likelihood that malicious emails will be delivered to users, or that users will be able to browse to malicious sites, reduces the risk of malware infection, and any impacts that may have on the security of our information and information systems. The following policies apply:\n\nAdministrators shall implement email and web filtering services for company email and internet.\nFiltering services shall be configured to update regularly so that the latest attacks and malicious sites are identified.\nWeb filtering controls shall be implemented in line with HR requirements such as enhanced protection is enabled on the default browser and HTTPS Only-mode is enabled.\nWhere possible, alerting should be implemented to at least indicate:\nWhen large volumes of spam are received (may indicate an attack or infected endpoint)\nWhen large numbers of false-positives are identified (poor configuration of the filtering software may lead to disruptions in operations)\nSoftware and application installation control\nAdministrators shall identify approved software and applications in the Approved Applications Register.\nEndpoints shall include company laptops, mobile phones, computers, networking devices, and servers, whether physical or virtual.\nWhere the software, application, or utility does not require elevated account privileges to be installed or run, or where the utility can override privilege requirements, these software programmes shall be identified and verified by administrators at scheduled intervals. The review schedule shall be dependent on the criticality assigned to the endpoint, and administrators shall ensure that any potential malicious activity detected is investigated.\nControlling Removable Media\n\nRemovable media includes, but is not limited to, USBs, CDs, DVDs, mobile phone storage, external hard-drives, backup tape media, etc. While removable media, and particularly USBs, are sometimes used to introduce malicious software and applications to company endpoints and networks, their primary purpose is to store and transfer data. Company data stored on removable media may be easily lost or stolen due to its portability. Removable media therefore poses a risk to the security of our IT systems and information. In the nature of Evercam operations there are no removable media utilised. In case of an ad-hoc scenario or job the following policies shall apply:\n\nWhere possible, administrators shall implement controls to block the use of removable media on all endpoints.\nEndpoints shall include company laptops, computers, mobile phones, networking devices, and servers, whether physical or virtual.\nIn situations where the use of removable media is unavoidable, the following controls shall be used:\nUSBs, external hard-drives, and SD cards shall be issued only by an authorised administrator, and shall be appropriately scanned and encrypted before use\nAuthorised administrators shall ensure that issued USBs, external hard-drives, and SD cards are recorded and tracked in the Equipment Register in line with section 3.1 of this document\nOnly company mobile phones which are appropriately managed shall be authorised to connect to company endpoints. Users shall not be permitted to connect personal mobile phones to company endpoints. Managed mobile phones shall be appropriately scanned and encrypted before use, and shall have remote wipe functionality enabled\nCDs and DVDs shall be appropriately scanned before use\nAdministrators should not provide users with CD/DVD burning facilities, wherever possible\nWhere tape media are required for information backup, data should be encrypted if possible, and only authorised administrators shall be permitted to handle backup tape media\nAll removable media shall be handled in line with the data transfer requirements documented in our Information Security Policy\nControlling Mobile Devices\n\nEvercam follows Bring your own device policy (BYOD). Where appropriate, the use of personal mobile devices is allowed as documented in our Information Security Policy. If a company phone is issued the device needs to be appropriately controlled in order to maintain the security of the information and services it may access and store. The following policies for securing mobile devices shall apply to company issued phones.\n\nMobile phones\nIf a company phone is issued it shall be recorded and tracked in the Equipment Register\nWherever possible, administrators should use an MDM solution to easily onboard and manage company mobile phones. Where an MDM solution is not available, solutions such as Exchange ActiveSync, Microsoft 365 Basic Mobility and Security, anti-virus mobile device controls, etc. should be investigated and implemented. Where no centralised management of mobile phones is available, administrators shall configure each company phone with a security baseline before it is issued to the user. Administrators shall configure the following minimum set of security controls for company mobile devices:\nThe device must be password protected with at least a PIN\nThe PIN shall be a minimum of 6 numbers\nThe device shall be configured to lock itself when it has been idle for more than 1 minute\nWhere possible, installation of apps shall be restricted, and only approved apps shall be installed\nOnly mobile phones with operating systems that use encryption as default shall be used\nWhere possible, the device shall be configured to support features to locate and/or remote wipe the device\nAnti-malware software shall be installed\nThe device shall be configured to automatically update\nAdministrators shall ensure company mobile phones are not jailbroken or rooted.\nAdministrators shall facilitate the installation of MDM software on personal mobile phones where requested by the user, and approved by their line manager.\nLaptops\n\nEvercam follows Bring your own device policy (BYOD) thus, it is expected that each employee is responsible for safe and secure use of their own work devices (laptops). The following rules apply:\n\nAll devices used for work must have company-approved antivirus and anti-malware software installed and kept up-to-date.\nDevices must be kept up to date with the latest security patches and updates.\nDevices should be password protected.\nMFA should be enabled to access company applications (Google and Zoho).\nCompany information cannot be stored on local device Save (documents to be saved on relevant Google Shared Drive / Zoho Work Drive).\nEmployees should not attempt to log into company applications (Zoho and Google) with a private user account.\nEmployees should not install unverified/unapproved applications or software.\nEmployees should ensure that their endpoint devices are adequately encrypted.\nLost or stolen devices must be reported to their immediate head and Support - Tech Ops department immediately (contact support@evercam.io).\n\nFor system update and recommended security settings go to Evercam IT Security Guide.\n\nIf an employee is found in breach of the above security recommendations they might be subject to Disciplinary action.\n\nHardening & Patching\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities can be introduced to our IT systems and information assets through misconfiguration, software bugs, and other weaknesses. To ensure that our IT systems and information assets are protected against these types of vulnerabilities, the following policies shall apply:\n\nAdministrators shall develop, document, and implement appropriate hardening controls for critical assets, whether they are virtual or physical devices, software, or services. Implementing the hardening guides will ensure that the assets have a minimum set of security controls configured before they are deployed to our organisation's network, or rolled-out to users.\n\nThese configuration controls should include, but may not be limited to:\n\nDisabling and/or removing all unnecessary services and applications\nEnsuring that operating systems and applications used are appropriately licensed, and patched to the latest approved versions\nManaging stored data so that test and/or configuration data is removed from the asset before deployment\nEncrypting drives and/or data stores with encryption at rest wherever necessary\nImplementing privileged access controls\nEnforcing 2FA for cloud-based software and services\nChanging default operating system and application credentials\nDisabling generic and/or default accounts wherever possible\nIf applicable, iInstalling anti-malware (or software firewall) controls as documented in this policy\nIf applicable, blocking removable media as documented in this policy\nImplementing controls for resource consumption to limit the impact of DDoS, or other capacity issues that might cause the asset to become unavailable\nEnabling alerts and logging as documented in this policy\n\nAdministrators shall review critical assets at regular intervals to ensure that security controls are implemented in line with the established hardening guides.\n\nAdministrators shall review established hardening guides at regular intervals to ensure they remain up-to-date in line with best practice recommendations, and available threat intelligence as documented in this policy.\n\nAdministrators shall maintain awareness of vulnerabilities and threats as documented in this policy and shall implement appropriate patching cycles for networking devices, and servers, whether physical or virtual. Patching cycles should take into consideration the criticality of the assets and associated services.\n\nAdministrators shall review patch levels at regular intervals and ensure that all endpoints are appropriately patched and up-to-date.\n\nAdministrators shall obtain the latest patches only from approved vendors, and shall verify the authenticity of any downloaded patches before deployment. Evercam utilises a CI/CD (continuous integration & continuous deployment) strategy. Daily and weekly updates are automatically deployed into production in minor versions including patches, bug fixes, and small improvements. Big and important feature changes are planned in monthly or bi-monthly updates.\n\nSecure Disposal\nInformation stored on assets can potentially be recovered even after they are removed from our organisation's network, and disposed of. Disposal of any asset containing company data must therefore be done securely, ensuring that any information remaining is no longer readable. The following policies shall apply:\nAdministrators shall ensure that all company external hard-drives, and SD cards that are wiped before users departure, ensure that new users cannot read or access previously stored data or user accounts.\nAdministrators shall ensure that all company endpoints that are end-of-life and due for destruction are securely destroyed either by:\nPhysical destruction such as shredding\nSecure erasure of data by authorised data erasure providers\nSecure erasure using approved data destruction software\nSecure erasure services provided by the applicable cloud-service provider\nErasure of encryption keys (cryptographic erasure can render the data unrecoverable if the encryption algorithm is a minimum of 128-bits)\nWhen using third-parties to destroy assets and associated data, administrators shall ensure that certificates of destruction are received, and that these are retained as evidence.\nAdministrators shall ensure that the assets are securely transferred to, or collected by, the third-party in line with the policy for physical data transfer in our Information Security Policy.\nAdministrators shall ensure that the Equipment Register is appropriately updated with the Date of Disposal, and the location of applicable certificates of destruction, where available.\nSystem Continuity & Information Backup\n\nSituations may occur where an IT system or information asset is compromised or fails, despite having the required controls in place. When this happens, it should be possible to restore the IT system or information asset, and recover the information to an acceptable level. The following policies shall apply for IT systems and information backup:\n\nAdministrators shall review our organisation's Critical Asset Register in conjunction with our Equipment Register, and shall identify appropriate system recovery and information backup procedures for all required assets in line with our organisation's business requirements.\nAdministrators shall document the system recovery and information backup procedures in formal Disaster Recovery Procedure/s, and shall make sure these are made available to all persons involved in the recovery procedures.\nAdministrators shall perform system recovery, and information backup and recovery procedures, in line with our documented Disaster Recovery Procedure/s.\nAdministrators shall ensure that system recovery procedures and information backups are reviewed and tested at regular intervals so that any failures can be investigated and corrected as soon as possible. When working with IaaS and virtualised environments, site mirroring and server or database cloning activities should be logged and monitored, and logs should be checked at intervals appropriate to the criticality of the environment. Where working with PaaS environments, appropriate redundancy measures should be identified and confirmed in line with the Supplier Due Diligence Policy.\nInformation Protection\n\nThere may be situations where additional technical protections are required to further restrict the access, copying, and sharing of sensitive or confidential data stored on, or processed using, our information assets. These additional technical protections are typically referred to as data masking and data loss prevention (DLP), or data leakage prevention techniques. The following policies shall apply for identifying and implementing suitable information protection techniques, where required:\n\nAdministrators shall work with data owners in line with sections 1.8.1 and 1.8.2 of the Data Handling & Retention Guidelines to identify appropriate technical controls for the protection of the information the data owner is responsible for. Types of additional controls may include, but are not limited to:\nEncryption\nMasking out\nPseudonymisation\nEmail DLP\nEndpoint DLP\nCloud-based information protection and governance systems\nDownload restriction\nRemovable device restriction\nThe extent and type of technical controls identified shall depend on the level of risk associated with the processing of the data, and the business, legal, regulatory, and/or contractual requirements applicable to our organisation. Data owners and administrators shall ensure the risk assessments are carried out in line with our Risk Management Process, and that suitable controls for data masking and DLP are implemented, where required.\nWhen determining whether additional technical controls are required, administrators shall take into consideration the access, network, and cryptographic controls already implemented in line with this policy.\nWhere it is determined that the logging and monitoring of copying or export operations associated with sensitive or confidential information is required, administrators shall ensure these activities are logged and monitored in line with this policy.\nProtecting Networks & Communications\n\nOur organisation's network is an important part of providing information services both internally to our users, and externally to our clients and other third-parties, and can be physical, virtual, cloud-based, or a combination. Our network, and communications technologies that we may use as part of that network, shall be appropriately protected to minimise any information security risks in line with our business requirements. The following policies apply for securing our network.\n\nSecure Network Design\nWhen designing the network, administrators shall apply the principle of defence in depth to ensure that information systems and assets are protected according to their criticality by applying multiple security controls such as those documented in this policy, and other network security controls such as IPS, IDS, etc.\nAdministrators shall ensure that appropriate firewall and routing technologies are implemented to secure the network perimeter and restrict network traffic to only authorised traffic.\nAdministrators shall ensure that all network routing rules are configured to deny traffic by default.\nAdministrators shall ensure that NAT is implemented wherever possible so that internal resources are not routable from public networks such as the internet.\nAdministrators shall ensure that the network is appropriately segregated so that compromise of one part of the network does not result in the entire network being compromised. For example, by using VLANs, subnets, VPCs, DMZs, multiple domains, etc.\nAdministrators shall ensure that network interfaces are configured to prevent access from unapproved devices and network traffic, or that they are not reachable from network segments with lower levels of security such as public networks, DMZs, etc.\nAdministrators shall ensure that industry standard cabling is used to support our organisation's capacity and performance requirements. Administrators shall ensure that service providers providing internet connectivity and/or cloud-based network infrastructure meet our organisation's performance, capacity, and availability requirements. Where necessary, secondary service providers shall be used for redundancy, and networks shall be appropriately configured to fail-over when required.\nWhere a number of mobile devices are used to connect to the network, administrators should consider implementing device authentication mechanisms such as RADIUS servers and Network Access Control (NAC), where appropriate.\nAdministrators shall not use deprecated and/or unsecure protocols such as telnet, SSL, and versions of SNMP prior to SNMPv3. Administrators shall maintain awareness of vulnerabilities and threats as documented in this policy, and ensure network protocols are appropriately secured and/or disabled where necessary.\nUsing Wi-Fi\n\nWhere Wi-Fi is used in our organisation's offices, the following policies shall apply:\n\nAdministrators shall ensure WPA2 is used to encrypt wireless traffic.\nAdministrators shall ensure that Wireless Access Points (WAPs) are placed in locations where they cannot be unplugged or damaged, which may cause disruption to users and services.\nAdministrators shall ensure that wireless traffic is appropriately segmented from the network where required. For example, where guest networks are provided for visitors, or where users are not permitted to access certain services from the wireless network.\nAdministrators shall ensure Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is disabled.\nAdministrators shall ensure the SSID of the wireless network is appropriately controlled. Controls may include:\nDisabling broadcast of the SSID\nRenaming of the SSID so that it is not easily identifiable as belonging to our organisation\nReducing the power level of the broadcast signal so that it is not easily accessible from outside of our offices\nAdministrators shall implement authentication mechanisms for wireless devices to reduce the risk of unapproved devices connecting to the network. Authentication controls may include:\nMAC address filtering\nNetwork security key rotation\nRADIUS\nSecurity certificates\nExternal Access & Connections\n\nWhere remote access to network resources is provided, administrators shall implement a suitable VPN for approved users and/or third-parties. The VPN shall include, but may not be limited to, the following controls:\n\nSupport for strong, industry standard encryption\nWhere a site-to-site VPN is used, routing and firewall rules shall be configured to deny all unapproved traffic\nWherever possible, 2FA should be used for authentication e.g. user credentials and security token\nPublic-facing services that facilitate the transfer of data across the internet and/or uncontrolled third-party networks shall be encrypted using strong, industry standard encryption.\nPublic-facing services that facilitate the transfer of data across the internet and/or uncontrolled third-party networks shall use strong authentication mechanisms such as 2FA, security tokens, cryptographic keys, etc. wherever possible to minimise the risk of unauthorised access.\nWhere third-parties require access to our network, administrators shall ensure that the external access is restricted to only authorised IP addresses and ranges, where possible.\nUsing Encryption\n\nServices used on our organisation's network shall be configured to encrypt their data in transit wherever possible. For example:\n\nWhere LDAP is a required service, LDAPS should be implemented\nWhere FTP is a required service, SFTP should be implemented\nWhere SNMP is required, SNMPv3 with authPriv should be implemented\n\nIn cloud-based infrastructure, administrators shall ensure that network traffic between virtual machines, routers, data containers, backup images, etc. are encrypted in transit wherever possible.\n\nNetwork Architecture with Encryption\n\nControlling Access\n\nImplementing appropriate access controls for information and associated information assets is essential to minimising the risk of unauthorised access, data breach, accidental modification, and other malicious or damaging activities that may originate from both inside and outside of our organisation. Information and associated information assets must be protected according to their classification, our business requirements, and our legal and regulatory requirements as documented in our Information Security Policy. Access control shall be implemented so that only authorised users have access to information and associated information assets. This section sets out our requirements for access control.\n\nManaging Passwords\n\nOne of the standard methods of authenticating access to IT systems and information is by using password management systems. The use of passwords and account controls has changed over time, and some password management systems no longer require rotation and expiry of passwords, but instead enforce passwords of greater length and complexity, along with secondary authentication such as biometrics, security tokens, device registration, etc. The following policies shall apply for our organisation.\n\nChoosing a password management system\nAdministrators shall ensure password management systems used for accessing an information system or service are risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process and that controls appropriate to the criticality of the system are identified and implemented.\nWhere appropriate access controls cannot be implemented, administrators should avoid using the information system or service where possible.\nWhere possible, administrators should consider the use of Single Sign-On (SSO) to ensure user account policy controls are applied consistently across information systems of similar criticalities, and to improve the security of registration and de-registration procedures.\nWhere information systems are accessible from the internet, administrators shall ensure that the password management system can implement 2FA.\nAt a minimum, the password management system should ensure administrators can configure the following account policy controls:\nPasswords with a minimum number of characters\nPasswords with a mix of numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and special symbols such as (*%!&) that prevent the use of dictionary words\nForced password expiry so that new passwords must be used periodically\nMinimum password reset time\nA password history so that passwords cannot be re-used frequently\nAccount lockout on repeated failure attempts to prevent brute-forcing of accounts. Administrators should use caution when implementing account lockout for some services as brute-force attacks may result in DoS where multiple accounts may become locked and inaccessible.\nOne-time use passwords\nAdministrators shall ensure the system masks passwords when entered so that they are not visible to other persons.\nAdministrators shall ensure the system does not allow passwords to be sent in the clear across the network or public-facing networks such as the internet.\nAdministrators shall ensure the system does not allow the enumeration of account usernames by allowing valid accounts to be identified. For example, where the user enters their password incorrectly, the system shall not indicate that authentication failed due to an incorrect password. In this scenario, a malicious attacker would then know that the username is valid, and may attempt to brute-force the account.\nAdministrators shall ensure that the system does not store account passwords with reversible encryption.\nManaging user accounts\nAdministrators shall create, modify, or disable user accounts in line with our Joiners/Movers/Leavers Procedure (JML Procedure).\nAdministrators shall assign account permissions according to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users are only given access to information and systems they are authorised to use.\nAdministrators shall use appropriate access controls to restrict user access to information in line with business requirements. Controls may include, but may not be limited to:\nMandatory Access Controls for restricting Highly Confidential data\nRole-based Access Control for assigning permissions based on the user's role and responsibilities\nWhere a user requests access to a system, service, and/or information, administrators shall confirm the access request with manager and the asset owner identified in Access Control Policy, or the asset owner identified in the Critical Asset Register. The asset owner assigned in the Critical Asset Register shall take precedence if ownership is unclear.\nAt a minimum, administrators shall configure the user account policy to require the following:\nPasswords with a minimum of 8 characters\nPasswords with a mix of numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and special symbols such as (*%!&) that prevent the use of dictionary words\nForced password expiry of 90 days unless 2FA is required\nA minimum password reset time of 1 day to prevent users from resetting their password too frequently\nA password history of at least 10 passwords to prevent frequent re-use of passwords\nAccount lockout of 30 minutes on 5 failed logon attempts. The account should automatically unlock after the 30 minute period, or IT can manually unlock the account upon request\nPassword reset on first logon or following manual password reset\nAdministrators shall ensure 2FA is enabled for users, where possible.\nAdministrators shall assign each user with a unique ID.\nAdministrators shall not re-use user IDs.\nWhen resetting passwords, or providing passwords to new users, administrators shall ensure a one-time password is used\nAdministrators shall not request users' passwords from them for any reason. When requiring access for support purposes, administrators shall reset the user's account before and after use, and only with user permission.\nAdministrators shall always confirm the identity of the user before responding to account reset requests.\nAdministrators shall perform user account and permissions audits at planned intervals, and shall ensure that the accounts and assigned permissions are reviewed and confirmed by line managers and/or asset owners, as appropriate.\nAll unused accounts shall be disabled.\nManaging privileged accounts\nAdministrators shall identify and document all privileged accounts used to perform administrative operations.\nAdministrators shall ensure that account privileges are granted and maintained based on the Access Control Policy.\nAdministrators shall ensure that only authorised accounts are used to perform their required administrative operations.\nWhen creating privileged accounts, the account name shall not easily identify the purpose of the account. For example, ExchangeAdminAccount, ActiveDirectoryAdministrator, etc.\nAdministrators shall avoid using root accounts wherever possible. Administrators should rather create new privileged accounts for the required roles and ensure root credentials are kept secure.\nAdministrators shall ensure that privileged accounts are used by authorised persons only.\nWhere accessing systems over the internet or other unmanaged networks using privileged accounts, 2FA shall be enabled\nAt a minimum, privileged accounts shall require the following policy:\nPasswords with a minimum of 12 characters\nPasswords with a mix of numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and special symbols such as (*%!&) that prevent the use of dictionary words\nWhere possible, administrators shall periodically reset privileged account passwords, and when persons with knowledge of privileged accounts leave the organisation.\nAdministrators shall periodically audit privileged accounts to ensure these are appropriately controlled.\nManaging generic accounts\n\nGeneric and service accounts may be used to run unattended operations, background services, provide temporary user or guest access, provide access to a shared account, etc. The following policy applies for managing generic and service accounts:\n\nAdministrators shall not create generic accounts for guest or temporary users. Each user must be provided with an account with a unique ID so that activity is auditable.\nWhere necessary, administrators can provide delegated permissions for an agreed period of time in situations where account sharing is unavoidable. This will ensure passwords and user IDs are not shared. Administrators shall confirm the request with the account and/or asset owner before delegating permissions.\nAdministrators shall identify and document all service accounts used to perform service operations.\nAdministrators shall ensure that each service account is only permitted to access the services and information assets it is authorised to access.\nAdministrators shall ensure that service accounts are not added to security or other privileged groups with permissions higher than it requires.\nAdministrators shall ensure that all unnecessary rights are removed from service accounts.\nAdministrators shall periodically audit service accounts to ensure these are appropriately controlled.\nCryptographic Controls\n\nOur organisation primarily uses cryptographic controls to protect the confidentiality and integrity of our data by encrypting it in transit and at rest, and to provide authentication to access IT systems and information assets by using public/private key pairs. This section sets out our requirements for managing cryptographic controls. The following policies apply:\n\nAdministrators shall ensure all IT systems and information assets are encrypted as required by this Policy. For example, Wi-Fi shall be encrypted using WPA2, Network services should be encrypted where possible, etc.\nWhere cryptographic controls are not explicitly mentioned in this document, administrators shall ensure that all IT systems and information assets are risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process to determine whether cryptographic controls are required, and what level of control is appropriate.\nAdministrators shall not use bespoke encryption or hashing algorithms. Administrators shall maintain awareness of security standards as documented in this policy, and use only strong, industry standard algorithms. Examples may include:\nApplication\tEncryption Type\nWeb-portals, websites, SaaS applications using HTTPS, Zoho Mail\tMinimum of TLSv1.2 and AES-256\nLaptop disk encryption\tNo company issued laptops. BYOD Policy guidelines on system inbuilt encryptions on employees' devices apply.\nPassword storage\tZoho Vault security. All users' passwords are encrypted using Bcrypt.\nVPN\tVPN infrastructure is standalone using WireGuard.\nAdministrators shall not use deprecated algorithms, or algorithms with known vulnerabilities.\nManaging Cryptographic Keys\n\nOur organisation may generate cryptographic keys for the following reasons, and should not be considered exhaustive:\n\nTo provide access to information assets and IT systems such as servers, databases, networking devices, cloud-based infrastructure, etc. whether physical or virtual\nTo encrypt data at rest such as with full disk encryption on laptops, data storage, backup tapes, etc.\nTo encrypt individual files or emails, etc.\nGenerating security certificates for protecting public-facing applications\n\nThe following policies apply:\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that a centralised key management system (KMS) is used, where possible. When maintaining cloud-based infrastructure, administrators should use KMS services provided, where available and appropriate.\nWhere keys cannot be centrally managed, administrators shall identify appropriate procedures for recording and storing keys.\nAdministrators shall ensure that access to key generation is restricted to authorised persons only.\nAdministrators shall ensure that keys are stored securely with restricted access, and are appropriately backed up to ensure that loss of the key store does not result in the loss of access to critical IT systems and information assets.\nAdministrators shall periodically test recovery of keys to ensure keys can be restored. Administrators shall implement procedures for rotating keys at regular intervals.\nAdministrators shall ensure keys are revoked in situations where the key may have become compromised, or when persons with knowledge of, or previous access to, keys leave the organisation.\nWhere possible, administrators shall configure keys to expire, and shall develop procedures for updating expired keys.\nAdministrators shall periodically review keys to ensure they are rotated, revoked, and expired as required.\nWhere using public-key infrastructure (PKI), administrators shall ensure that certificate authorities (CAs) and registration authorities (RAs) are trusted.\nLogging and Monitoring\n\nTo assist in identifying issues such as malicious activity, misconfigurations, incidents, security incidents, service failures, etc. it is critical that our organisation ensure that activities that take place on our organisation's network, IT systems, and information assets are appropriately logged and monitored. This section sets out our requirements for the auditing and review of logging information. The following policies apply:\n\nAdministrators shall ensure all IT systems and information assets are audited and monitored as required by this Information Systems Security Policy and Audit Log Management Policy.\nWhere requirements for logging and monitoring are not explicitly mentioned in this document, administrators shall ensure that all IT systems and information assets are risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process to determine whether logging and monitoring is required, and what level of logging is appropriate.\nWhere possible, administrators shall ensure that all IT systems and information assets are configured with a single time source. The time source shall be a trusted, external source. Ensuring system clocks are synchronised across information assets will ensure log data can be accurately compared when investigating incidents and troubleshooting issues.\nWhere possible, a security information and event management (SIEM) system should be used to centralise the capture and monitoring of log data.\nThe level of logging configured shall be appropriate to the criticality of the information asset. Log data should include, but may not be limited to:\nDate and time data\nAccess control events such as log on, log off, login failure/success events, etc. The use of service accounts and utility programmes that are restricted\nModification of particular files, services, configurations, etc.\nService and application faults\nAdministrators shall review log data at regular intervals to minimise the risk of potential security incidents remaining unnoticed. Where possible, alerts shall be configured so that certain log events, or logs generated by critical assets, can be prioritised and responded to appropriately.\nAdministrators shall ensure that only authorised persons have access to log data. Log data shall be protected from modification and/or deletion at all times.\nAdministrators shall not be able to modify and/or delete any administrator or operator logs associated with their own activities.\nLog data shall be retained for a minimum of 3 months, or where our organisation's data retention requirements may require additional retention times.\nSystem Testing\n\nAs changes are made to our IT systems, services, and information assets, new vulnerabilities and weaknesses may be introduced. New threats are also emerging on a daily basis. Independent system testing at planned intervals can assist in ensuring that our IT systems and information assets continue to be adequately protected in line with our organisation's requirements. The following policies for system testing shall apply:\n\nRequired testing activities shall be identified based on the criticality of the system or asset.\nAdministrators shall ensure a risk assessment is carried out in line with our Risk Management Process to ensure appropriate levels and frequency of testing are identified.\nAll testing shall be appropriately planned and scoped so that business operations are not negatively impacted. System testers shall not exceed the scope of the planned testing activities.\nSystem testers shall be appropriately trained to carry out the testing activity. Where necessary, third-party security analysts and penetration testers should be contracted to perform testing activities.\nSystem testers shall be independent i.e. they shall not test information systems or assets that they are responsible for administering. System testers shall give asset owners advanced notice of any testing being carried out, and shall obtain permission from the asset owner.\nWhere testing may include cloud-based services and infrastructure, or other third-party providers, system testers must obtain permission from the cloud-service provider and/or third-party to carry out the testing.\nSystem testers shall record the results of their tests, and provide recommendations for remediation.\nWhere weaknesses are identified, administrators shall perform a risk assessment in line with our Risk Management Process.\nIdentifying & Reporting Incidents\n\nAdministrators play a key role in the identification and reporting of potential security incidents, and are frequently first responders. Where a potential security incident has been reported, either by a user, another administrator, or in situations where an administrator notices a potential incident themselves, the following policies shall apply:\n\nAdministrators shall adhere to our Incident Response Procedure and alert our Incident Response Team (IRT) to the incident. The IRT will determine next steps for handling the incident.\nAdministrators shall not attempt to trace or track a malicious attacker. Priority shall be given to alerting the IRT and following our Incident Response Procedure. Where an administrator prioritises catching a potential malicious attacker, this may increase the impact of the attack on our information systems and assets.\nAdministrators shall assist users in performing initial containment activities such as disabling network connectivity, unplugging removable media, etc.\nAdministrators shall participate in regular incident response training exercises to ensure that they are familiar with our Incident Response Procedure.\nPerforming Reviews\n\nLike security testing, auditing and review activities are essential to ensure that the development, management, and maintenance of our IT systems and information assets remain in line with the requirements of this policy. Review activities will also assist in identifying potential improvements. The following policies apply for performing reviews:\n\nAdministrators shall ensure all review activities are performed as required by this Information Systems Security Policy.\nWhere requirements for performing reviews or audits are not explicitly mentioned in this document, administrators shall ensure that all IT systems and information assets are risk assessed in line with our Risk Management Process to determine whether periodic review or auditing is required.\nAdministrators shall retain evidence of review or auditing activities. Evidence may include, but may not be limited:\nChecklists that contain the date, what was checked, and who carried out the check\nReports containing testing results\nUser lists with last login information and confirmation of permissions from line managers or asset owners, as appropriate\n\nAdministrators shall ensure that evidence of review or auditing activities is controlled, and protected from unauthorised access and tampering.\n\nCreated by: Compliance Manager (ISMS team)\n\nCreation date: 01.08.2023\n\nLast modification date: 09.01.2025\n\nDocument approver: Director of support\n\nBook a demo\nContact\n\n6-7 Granby Row, Dublin 1, Ireland\n+353 1 919 4500\n\n\n\nOther Locations\nIE\nUK\nSG\nAU\nUS\nPL\nConstruction Cameras\nCamera Specs\nProjects\nPricing\nTutorials\nBlog\nResources\nE-books\nCase Studies\nReality Capture\nSitemap\nProductivity\nSoftware Integrations\nProject Management\nMarketing\nA.I. for Construction\nAbout\nTerms & Conditions\nGDPR compliance\nTrust Center\nAbout\nContact Us\nCareers\nTestimonials\nPartners\nBecome An Installer\nFind An Installer\nFeatures\nTime-lapse\nLive View\nRecordings\nGate Report\nX-Ray\nBIM Integration\nDrones in Construction\nProgress Photos\nZoom\nCompare Tool\nMark-up Tool\nGoogle Play\n \nApple Store\n\n \nWhatsApp\n \nGithub\n \nLinkedin\n \nTwitter\n \nFacebook\n \nVimeo\n \nYoutube\n \nInstagram"

Policy statement\n\nEvercam is committed to ensuring the availability, integrity, and security of our ICT systems and data. As such, regular and reliable backups are essential to mitigate information security risks and threats. Evercam ensures that all essential business information and software are backed up to allow recovery from\n\nDisasters;\nData loss;\nHardware, media, and system failures;\nCyber attacks;\nUser errors.\n\nThis policy outlines the procedures and responsibilities for implementing and maintaining a comprehensive backup and recovery strategy in line with our business, legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements.\n\nKey points\nBackups are regular;\nThe backup is securely stored;\nBackup data is retained for a minimum of [1] years;\nThe backup process should not adversely affect the other network users;\nAll essential (electronic) business information and software is stored on the secure servers;\nWhere possible, all paper-based essential business information is scanned and stored on the file servers;\nOnly data stored on the networked servers qualify for backup;\nData recoveries are regular and can range from a server restore to an individual file;\nRetain the ability to recover historic data using obsolete/old backup software.\nResponsibilities\n\nAll users have an individual responsibility to ensure that:\n\nEssential Company information and software are stored correctly for backup and in line with its data classification.\nTemporary, unnecessary, and duplicate data stored on the network is managed and deleted in a timely manner.\nData should only be saved to GDrive or Zoho Work Drive.\nAll owners of essential Company information and software are required to ensure that backup arrangements and procedures are in place to safeguard the data.\nThe Ops and Devs Departments are responsible for the execution of the backup & recovery procedures and for identifying and reporting any faults, failures, or errors. This includes selecting appropriate backup methods, monitoring backups, and testing recovery processes regularly. The Ops and Devs Departments together with the ISMS team are also responsible for documenting, testing, and maintaining the backup and recovery process in line with the business needs.\nThe ISMS team and system administrators are responsible for configuring and scheduling backups according to the defined procedures. They must ensure that backups are completed successfully and regularly review the backup logs for any issues.\nData owners are responsible for identifying critical data and applications that require regular backups. They should communicate changes in data retention requirements to the ISMS team and/or Ops/Devs department.\nPaper-Based Data\n\nAll Essential Company data whose master copy is in paper format is stored in the following locations:\n\nMaster Copy – securely stored as per its data classification, preferably in a fire safe/cabinet.\nPaper Copy – if required, should be stored as per its data classification within the relevant department for general reference.\nElectronic Copy – scanned and stored on the file servers in suitable locations depending on data classification.\nElectronic-Based Data\n\nIt is the responsibility of each user to ensure that electronic-based data is properly stored to ensure backup and recovery. The appropriate manager is responsible for ensuring that suitable backup & recovery procedures are in place. For a summary of Evercam key electronic system backups refer to the table below. \n\nnEvercam core systems backups \n\nSystem\tType of data\tLocation\tFrequency of backup\tPerson in charge\nZoho People\tEmployee data\tCloud and Zoho data centres \tevery 7 days\tDirector of Support\nZoho Email\tEmployee and customer data\tCloud and Zoho data centres \tEvercam has an e-discovery policy enabled for email which means that all emails even if they have been deleted are retained.

Backup and Recovery Procedure \n\nIn line with our ISMS Evercam follows the Business Continuity Policy and Incident Response Procedure in the event of disasters, data loss, cyber-attacks, hardware, media, and/or system failures etc. To recover from such a situation one must escalate through a series of procedures until a satisfactory restoration is met. As Evercam is a remote-first company this procedure covers the backup and restoration of electronic data held on external servers. Paper-based data is NOT covered by this procedure. \n\nResponsibility\n\nIt is the Technology Lead and Director of Support responsibility to manage, monitor, and audit the backup and recovery procedures for data held on designated servers. \n\nScope \n\nThe backup and restore procedures are essential to our business. Their primary purpose is to aid in disaster recovery to minimise the amount of data lost after a disaster has occurred e.g.  equipment failure, data corruption, loss of power, etc. Their secondary purpose is to allow the recovery  of specific files requested by individuals. This document outlines the step-by-step procedures for conducting backups and performing data recovery in Evercam. These procedures are designed to ensure the availability, integrity, and security of critical data and systems.\n\nBackup procedure\nData Classification and Selection\n\nIdentify and classify data based on its criticality and importance. Prioritise critical systems, databases, source code, and user data for regular backups.\n\nBackup Schedule\n\nPlease refer to the table above (Evercam core systems backups).\n\nBackup Methods\n\nSelect an appropriate backup method: Full Backups: Create complete copies of selected data and systems on a scheduled basis. Incremental Backups: Capture changes made since the last full backup. Perform incremental backups daily.\n\nBackup Execution\n\nSystem administrators will initiate backups using the designated backup software or tools (contacting a dedicated support contact for third-party systems)\n\nEnsure backups are stored in designated backup storage locations\n\nTypes of backup retention: Daily Backups: Retain backups for 7 days. Weekly Backups: Retain backups for 4 weeks. Regularly monitor and manage backup storage to ensure sufficient space.\n\nOffsite Storage\n\nStore a copy of backups off-site in a secure and controlled environment. Maintain a documented inventory of off-site backup storage.\n\nEmail backup \n\nEvercam has enabled eDiscovery, Email Retention, and backup for our Zoho mail server.  An email retention policy and eDiscovery help Evercam to stay compliant with retention laws, handle lawsuits and litigations, avoid witness tampering, and investigate theft of information or contractual disputes. \n\nIn summary, our email backup is:\n\nBy the default retention policy, all emails (including spam/deleted) will be retained for ever. \nMails older than the above retention period are considered expired emails and are purged from storage once every 10 days.\nBackups have no retention period - emails are stored forever.\nEmails from suspended or removed accounts are also retained.\nAt any point in time Evercam can launch investigations and place holds on or export emails.\nAt any point in time Evercam can recover and expunge emails.\nAt any point in time Evercam can restore emails that have been accidentally or purposely deleted.\nAt any point in time Evercam can scan all mailboxes for a particular email (for example a phishing email that we know has been received) and delete it from employees' inboxes.\nDatabase (server) backup \n\nEvercam database covering users' passwords and credentials, projects, links between cameras and users, and events managed by the Evercam platform is backed up in AWS servers automatically with Heroku as the main interface to manage backups. The availability and durability levels of the AWS backups are guaranteed through SLA. \n\nEvercam follows a two-fold strategy:\n\nThe database is backed up in regular intervals: weekly (managed by Heroku and stored in AWS).\nA real-time copy of each second of the last 4 days is generated every 4 days (managed by Heroku and stored in AWS).\n\nThe customer recordings from the site are stored in Hertzner servers. To ensure the backup full frame recordings can be retrieved from hard drives and NVR installed locally in the Evercam kit on site. These can be accessed remotely to retrieve the necessary data. To monitor the performance Evercam relies on Grafana as a tool to query and visualize logs and metrics. It allows us to control our hard drives' performance metrics remotely. Grafana is used daily by our Dev team. Evercam relies also on Prometheus as a system that alerts DevOps (via email) about issues and irregularities (when a metric is going above/beyond a threshold) when it comes to our hard drives. Prometheus is used to collect metrics from servers (CPU, Memory, Network, and Storage).\n\nEmergency response\n\nIn case of emergency (hardware issues such as loss of a hard drive) the procedure is to email Hetzner support system support@hetzner.com\n\nCode backup \n\nEvercam source code is stored on Github with Cloud servers located in the USA (Seattle and Northern Virginia). Regular automated backups of code repositories are performed in real-time. Backups must be encrypted during transmission and storage to protect sensitive code and data from unauthorised access. Periodic restoration tests should be conducted to ensure the viability of backups for recovery purposes.\n\nDevelopers are responsible for committing their code to the designated repositories and ensuring that the code is up-to-date. Regular commits reduce the risk of code loss.\n\nBy adhering to this Code Backup Policy, we aim to maintain the integrity of our code repositories and enable swift recovery in the face of data loss or other unforeseen events. This policy underscores our commitment to data security, continuous availability, and the overall success of our development efforts.\n\nRecovery Procedures\nData Restoration\n\nIn case of data loss or system failure, follow these steps for data recovery: Identify the data or systems to be restored based on the nature of the incident. Reach out to the dedicated support contact assigned to a given system. The contacts are listed in the Evercam Business Continuity Plan Contact Sheet\n\nThe dedicated contact will access the most recent backup that contains the required data. The dedicated contact will restore the data using the designated recovery procedures and tools. Verify the restored data for accuracy and integrity.\n\nDisaster Recovery\n\nIn the event of a larger-scale disruption, such as a system-wide failure or disaster, follow these steps: Activate the company's disaster recovery procedure. Reach out to the dedicated support contact assigned to a given system. The contacts are listed in the Evercam Business Continuity Plan Contact Sheet. They will: Retrieve the necessary off-site backups and hardware. Restore critical systems and data according to the disaster recovery plan. Perform testing to ensure the functionality and integrity of recovered systems.\n\nTo identify the best recovery methods to use, the following data is required: When did the problem occur? Is the data stored in a general area backed up? When was the last backup?\n\nDepending on the answers above, the best recovery method is applied. Time is important and the quicker the loss/corruption is found, the quicker the recovery will be.\n\nTesting and Monitoring\nBackup Testing\n\nRegularly perform test restores from backups to ensure data recoverability. Document and address any issues identified during testing.\n\nBackup Monitoring\n\nContinuously monitor backup logs for any failures or errors. Investigate and resolve backup issues promptly.\n\nDocumentation and Reporting\n\nMaintain comprehensive documentation of backup and recovery procedures, including schedules, methods, and test results. Provide regular reports to management on the status of backups, recoveries, and any incidents.\n\nTraining\n\nEnsure that system administrators are trained on the proper execution of backup and recovery procedures. Conduct regular training sessions and refresher courses as needed.\n\nReview and Update\n\nRegularly review and update this procedure to reflect changes in technology, data needs, and company requirements.\n\nn\n\nCreated by: Head of Compliance (ISMS team) \n\nCreation date: 08.08.2023\n\nLast modification date: 21.11.2024\n\nDocument approver: Chief Technology Officer\n\nBook a demo\nContact\n\n6-7 Granby Row, Dublin 1, Ireland\n+353 1 919 4500\n\n\n\nOther Locations\nIE\nUK\nSG\nAU\nUS\nPL\nConstruction Cameras\nCamera Specs\nProjects\nPricing\nTutorials\nBlog\nResources\nE-books\nCase Studies\nReality Capture\nSitemap\nProductivity\nSoftware Integrations\nProject Management\nMarketing\nA.I. for Construction\nAbout\nTerms & Conditions\nGDPR compliance\nTrust Center\nAbout\nContact Us\nCareers\nTestimonials\nPartners\nBecome An Installer\nFind An Installer\nFeatures\nTime-lapse\nLive View\nRecordings\nGate Report\nX-Ray\nBIM Integration\nDrones in Construction\nProgress Photos\nZoom\nCompare Tool\nMark-up Tool\nGoogle Play\n \nApple Store\n\n \nWhatsApp\n \nGithub\n \nLinkedin\n \nTwitter\n \nFacebook\n \nVimeo\n \nYoutube\n \nInstagram"

It also allows for the prioritising, and remediating of any potential vulnerabilities in enterprise systems and software. The audit log management policy provides the processes and procedures for ensuring logs are created and properly analysed. This policy applies to all departments and all assets connected to the Evercam network.\n\nResponsibility \n\nThe Engineering (Eng) department is responsible for all log management functions. Specifically, administrators are responsible for configuring the correct devices to generate, store, and transmit logs. Eng is responsible for informing all users of their responsibilities in the use of any assets assigned to them, such as applying updates in a regular manner or restarting their systems. All enterprise assets are required to comply with the enterprise audit logging procedures.\n\nPolicy \nGeneration\nAn enterprise-wide strategy must be developed to establish and maintain an audit log process. \nThis strategy must be documented.\nDocumentation must be updated annually, or when significant changes have occurred. \nThe contents of logs must be specified within the secure configuration policy. \nAudit logging must be enabled on all enterprise assets, as is practical. \nAudit logs must not be disabled on enterprise assets. \nTransmission \nProcedures must be developed to move logs from enterprise assets to an audit log datastore. \nLogging system (Engineering docs) details the procedures made to move logs from enterprise assets to a remote datastore.\nStorage\nAll enterprise assets (servers, apps, edge devices) generate logs in json format locally.\nPromtail is used to collect local logs from different sources (system, apps, files) and push them to logs data store. Loki, a log aggregator, ensures logs management, querying, storage, and retention…etc\nSufficient storage space must be allocated for audit logs for the period of time required for analysis and retention. \nSufficient space must be allocated to store audit logs on all enterprise assets. \nSufficient space must be allocated to store audit logs on any centralised audit log datastore. \nReview and Analysis \nAll high severity events must be acted upon in accordance with the audit log management process. \nRetention timeframes for audit logs should be in accordance with the enterprise data management process.\nIn general, Logs are saved for three months. For querying logs performance, only the last month logs are available for review and analysis. the previous 2 months logs are saved in archived state.\nAccess controls must be used to prevent audit logs from being modified in an unauthorised manner. The only interface to query logs is by using Grafana (Access control implemented). Once Logs are stored, they can't be modified.\nSome specific audit logs, like Camera logs, are required to be saved for longer and to be available for review and analysis while the project is in progress. These logs are available in Admin app for Evercam employees only.\nDisposal \nAll audit logs must be stored for a period of time specified by the audit log management process. \nArchived logs can be available for analysis.\nDisposal of audit logs should be in accordance with the enterprise data management process.\nSummary of Evercam Log management Systems\nLog management system\tPurpose (Use case)\tWho reviews it (Teams)\tReview process\tRetention period\nGrafanaIt is a platform for monitoring, visualisation, and alerting.

This Business Ethics Policy outlines our principles and guidelines for all employees, contractors, suppliers, and partners to ensure that we maintain a culture of ethical conduct and responsible business practices. It is our collective responsibility to uphold these standards and to foster an environment where ethical behaviour is valued, promoted, and celebrated.\n\nScope \n\nThe Business Ethics Policy applies to all individuals associated with Evercam Limited, including employees, contractors, suppliers, and partners. It covers all aspects of their roles and responsibilities, ensuring ethical behaviour in areas such as compliance with laws and regulations, conflict of interest, confidentiality and data privacy, fair competition, workplace respect and diversity, environmental responsibility, supplier and partner relationships, reporting and whistleblower protection. This policy sets the expectations for ethical conduct and guides the actions of everyone involved in Evercam. \n\nCompliance with Laws and Regulations\n\nAll individuals associated with Evercam must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and legal obligations. This includes, but is not limited to, laws related to anti-corruption, antitrust, data protection, intellectual property, fair competition, and insider trading. It is crucial to understand and follow the legal requirements relevant to our business operations and to promptly report any suspected violations.\n\nConflict of Interest\n\nAll employees must avoid situations that could create a conflict of interest between their personal interests and the interests of Evercam. A conflict of interest arises when personal relationships, financial interests, or external activities interfere with the ability to make impartial and objective business decisions. Employees must promptly disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest to their immediate supervisor or the appropriate authority.\n\nConfidentiality and Data Privacy\n\nProtecting confidential information and maintaining the privacy of personal data is vital to our business. Employees must handle all confidential and sensitive information, whether it belongs to Evercam, our customers, or partners, with the utmost care and discretion. Personal data should only be collected, used, and shared in compliance with applicable data protection laws and our internal policies. For further reference please refer to the relevant Evercam policies. \n\nFair Competition\n\nWe are committed to promoting fair competition and adhering to all laws and regulations related to competition.

It is essential to respect the rights and intellectual property of competitors, customers, and other stakeholders.\n\nWorkplace Respect and Diversity\n\nWe value a diverse and inclusive work environment, where all individuals are treated with respect, dignity, and fairness. Discrimination or harassment based on race, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other protected characteristic will not be tolerated. All employees are expected to contribute to a positive and inclusive workplace culture.\n\nEnvironmental Responsibility\n\nWe recognise the importance of environmental sustainability and are committed to minimising our impact on the environment. We strive to integrate sustainable practices into our operations, reduce waste, conserve resources, and comply with environmental regulations. It is everyone's responsibility to support these efforts and promote environmental stewardship.\n\nSupplier and Partner Relationships\n\nWe expect our suppliers, contractors, and business partners to uphold similar ethical standards. We strive to work with partners who share our commitment to integrity, fair practices, and responsible business conduct. We encourage open and honest communication with suppliers and partners, promoting transparency and a shared dedication to ethical principles.\n\nReporting and Whistleblower Protection\n\nWe encourage all employees to report any concerns, suspected violations, or potential breaches of this policy without fear of retaliation. Evercam maintains confidential reporting channels to allow for anonymous reporting, where appropriate. We are committed to investigating reported concerns promptly and taking appropriate action.\n\nPolicy Compliance \n\nAll employees are required to read, understand, and comply with this Business Ethics Policy. Regular training programs will be provided to promote awareness of ethical issues and to ensure employees have the necessary knowledge to uphold these principles. Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\\n\n\nBy adhering to this Business Ethics Policy, we demonstrate our commitment to conducting business in a manner that upholds the highest ethical standards. Each individual associated with Evercam plays a vital role in maintaining and fostering a culture of integrity, responsibility, and trust. Together, we can contribute to the success of our organisation while making a positive impact on our employees, customers, partners, and the communities we serve.\n\n\\n\n\nCreated by: Head of Compliance (ISMS team) \n\nCreation date: 14.07.2023\n\nLast modification date: 21.11.2024\n\nDocument approver: Chief People Officer\n\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

It requires no intervention from the operator and it in no way affects the operation of the existing telephony software.\nHandles all events: The system is fully automated and responds to incoming and outgoing calls. It responds on call answer, re-queuing and hang up events.\nDevice independence: the system works with any Tunstall device that triggers event via Tunstall telephony software: smoke alarms, sensors, fobs, Lifeline units etc…\nPrivacy: video only accessible during event (by normal ER operator)\nLow bandwidth: since video is only streamed during an event the bandwidth implications for both ER management and customer is minimal.\nLogged calls:  A log is recorded of all calls received and videos watched.\nAdministrator Login\nData Management Portal\n\nThe system features a data management portal which will allow Tunstall to manage all data related to the cameras within the system.\n\nThe portal facilitates entry of the minimal customer information required.\n\nThe portal allows for the addition of camera information for each customer, as well as serving as the entry point for direct access to the camera itself.\n\nIt also provides access to the viewing logs which allow administrators to see which video streams were watched, when and by whom.\n\n Camera Installation Process\n\nEvercam have defined and documented all procedures relating to the installation and configuration of the camera hardware required to interact with the system.\n\n \n\n \n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

We like to know who we’re doing business with and we like to buy things from people we trust.\n\nThat’s why companies like Tesla and Rover have made the seemingly radical decision to open up their CCTV systems to their customers. They’ve turned the very definition of Closed Circuit Television on its head by opening it up and turning it into a powerful sales and marketing tool.\n\nCustomers of both the latest Tesla electric cars and the new Rover Mini can actually watch as their own personal vehicle is assembled. And why shouldn’t they ? These factories contain some of the greatest technology and manufacturing excellence in the world … that’s what the customers are buying when they choose these brands.\n\nMake no mistake, this change was not lead by the security department, long conditioned to think in the mindset of keeping others out, locking down access and protecting the companies secrets. These innovations were led by the marketing departments who know the value of inviting customers in, of building trust and pride in not only the appearance of the company, but also the core internal processes.\n\nHowever it’s not only a marketing tool, we’re seeing the same drive for transparency coming from other directions too. In particular in the food industry where mistakes in one part of the supply chain can cause long term damage to the entire industry affecting everyone from the farmer to the retailer. Here in Ireland, where agriculture is a cornerstone of our economy, we have led the way with transparency. Even in the places one might least expect to find the sharing of video information – the meat processing plants – it is now a requirement by the major retailers that they have on demand access to the CCTV on the factory floor. As Lenin said, “Trust is good, control is better”.\n\nFrom the business owner’s perspective, the opportunities here for competitive differentiation are huge and the great news is that in most cases it’s just a case of getting some value out of a cost that has already been sunk. Usually the cameras are already in place, it’s just a case of hooking them up to a system such as Evercam that allows fine grained, secure control over who can see what and then reaping the benefits of a more open, more efficient organisation.\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Workshops were also running throughout the day while the pitching was going.  The general consensus was that these were very useful.\n\nCongratulations to the Spanish winners Seabery Solutions and thanks to DBIC for organising it.\n\nPost-pitchin’ at Silicon Stroll\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

This is amazing for us.  Not only does it mean we get to take part in a nine month intensive accelerator program, we also get office space for the company and mentoring from industry experts.\n\nThe whole day was really enjoyable and so smoothly organised by the Wayra team.  They were hugely professional and looked after all of us nervous looking folk.\n\nWe’ll be celebrating with champagne and kayaking down the Liffey past our new offices.\n\nCheck out the video of the finals.\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

The best known social media channels have for some time now championed the power of accessibility, connectivity and unity.\n\nWhether its Skype allowing a grandfather see his granddaughter 7,000 miles away or Twitter allowing fans from all corners of the world have instant real time updates; from the life of their favourite celebrity.\n\nFacebook makes it possible for you to follow the progress of a long lost friend in detail, so much so that no life surprises arrive should you meet them for the first time in 5 years! Instagram, provides users with a list of pictures relative to a person, place, thing, word or topic. While Vine, builds the same with their intermittent video approach.\n\nAll these successful companies had and have different social strategies for success. Common to all however, is the incredible power of imagery.  Be it in video or picture form, imagery can afford people a more detailed description than even most descriptive language. It feels more real and speaks all languages.\n\nHere at Evercam, we believe in the power of the image and more importantly, the camera. Our overall mission is to make cameras programmable. Our API allows developers to interact with social media API’s like never before.\n\nFor example, how would you like a ‘tweet-able’ camera?!\n\nAbove, we see where a hashtag in a tweet creates a call to action that triggers a response with a live image. Essentially, a user can tweet a camera and have it tweet back its view 😮\n\nNow…. What can you think of to have Twitter and cameras work in unison? Or… Cameras and Facebook or Instagram or Vine or Flickr or Pinterest or Tumblr or Flickr or………….. ? Facebook recently revealed we upload a whooping 350 million photos per day! Are you ready to explore boundless possibilities?\n\nConnect to Evercam now and open up a world of Social Media potential!\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nBook a demo\nContact\n\n6-7 Granby Row, Dublin 1, Ireland\n+353 1 919 4500\n\n\n\nOther Locations\nIE\nUK\nSG\nAU\nUS\nPL\nConstruction Cameras\nCamera Specs\nProjects\nPricing\nTutorials\nBlog\nResources\nE-books\nCase Studies\nReality Capture\nSitemap\nProductivity\nSoftware Integrations\nProject Management\nMarketing\nA.I. for Construction\nAbout\nTerms & Conditions\nGDPR compliance\nTrust Center\nAbout\nContact Us\nCareers\nTestimonials\nPartners\nBecome An Installer\nFind An Installer\nFeatures\nTime-lapse\nLive View\nRecordings\nGate Report\nX-Ray\nBIM Integration\nDrones in Construction\nProgress Photos\nZoom\nCompare Tool\nMark-up Tool\nGoogle Play\n \nApple Store\n\n \nWhatsApp\n \nGithub\n \nLinkedin\n \nTwitter\n \nFacebook\n \nVimeo\n \nYoutube\n \nInstagram"

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nDate : 02-04-2015 Last Modified Date : 16-04-2020\n   \nEvercam Public Cameras – A Redesign\nThe Objective\n\nImprove the on-boarding process and user experience by enabling potential and current Evercam users to explore, preview and add public cameras to their account.\n\nOverview\n\nAny camera added to Evercam by our users can be made public. If a user makes their camera public, it will automatically be added to our map of public cameras that users can explore to find cameras and add them to their account.\n\nThe problems\n\nOur current Public Camera area fails to deal with a few key issues we have identified from a development and user point of view.\n\n#1 Camera density\nWe have a large and growing number of cameras in the Evercam system. New cameras are constantly being added to the map and particular areas have a high concentration of cameras resulting in a clutter of pins in a small area.\n\n#2 Relevancy of camera to the user (by location & content\nAllowing users to explore all of our cameras in locations relevant to them and being able to see what content the camera contains involves a lot of click and drag. The map is not searchable so the user needs to click and drag to get to a location. Then the user needs to click on a pin to see a preview of a camera. It is not easy to get to a particular location and finding a camera with content that a user may be interested in involved a game of click and reveal. It’s certainly not fun and it’s only barely usable.\n\nInsights\n\nSo the actionable insights which have arisen are a) users need to be able to get to where they want to go to on the map quicker. , b) we need to find a better way to organise pins or cameras at different zoom levels where a large number of cameras exist and c) the user needs to be able to preview cameras more easily\n\nInspiration\n\nI looked around at various sites on the web that offer a similar service. Each of them try to deal with at least one of the above problems in some way.\n\nwunderground.com show a preview of the camera but don’t deal with the issue of camera clutter or search.\n\n\nwebcams.travel deal with the issue of clutter from a developers perspective but give the user no indication of camera density in an area. Their solution for search leaves room for improvement.\n\n\nwebcamsinnorway.com and geocam.tv respectively, deal with the issue of clutter nicely but still have the issue where the user needs to click each camera pin to get a preview of the camera. So the experience from far away is good but when a user zooms in closer the click to reveal game begins.\n\nThe Solution\n\nHaving looked at various sources of inspiration from around the web and having identified the main pain points for a user when trying to find cameras, I proposed the following design solutions.\n\na) The user can either search on the map by a specific location, or search for cameras near their current location. b) Where a large number of cameras exist in close proximity relative to the zoom level of the map, the number of cameras in a location is indicated by a number on top of the camera preview. And regarding c) a preview of the cameras currently on display in the map are shown in the left sidebar and a preview is put in place of the pin on the map. Hovering over any of the in the left sidebar will reveal it’s location on the map to the user. This allows the user to search by a location they are interested in and also to browse cameras and find cameras where purely the content of the camera is what is of interest.\n\nSummation\n\nAll of the above references deal with at least one of the issues that arise for developers when trying to place a large number of cameras on the map and for users when trying to find relevant cameras by location and content in a cluttered areas. The proposed design is solution attempts to tackle all of the problems identified and to make it easier for potential users to discover cameras that are relevant to them either geographically or by the content they provide and ultimately to improve the overall user experience for our current and potential users.\n\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Last year, as an experiment, they included a live image of each parcel as it was being shipped to their customer.\n\nThis is the story of the impact it had on their business.\n\n“Overnight we saw the number of customer complaint calls collapse. We also believe it had a positive impact on the care and attention paid by our workforce on the packaging line.”\n\nImmediately the cost overheads were reduced and customer satisfaction was increased.\n\n“A secondary benefit came from what we call “The WOW factor” … customers started posting online about how delighted they were to see the actual picture of the parcel before it got to them. This was new to them and it emphasised the association of MIck’s Garage with technology, innovation, and automation.”\n\nInstant retrieval of these images had other unexpected benefits too:\n\n “Despite working with the best delivery companies, sometimes packages go missing. By being able to provide pictures of each parcel it was easier for them to find and recover lost items.”\n\nEvercam provide software to any company that helps them to integrate cameras or images into their business processes. We’ve helped process over 4m live camera images since 2010 and currently handle more than 50,000 each day. Evercam solutions are in place for industries as diverse as food production, tourism, social media and supply chain management.\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nBook a demo\nContact\n\n6-7 Granby Row, Dublin 1, Ireland\n+353 1 919 4500\n\n\n\nOther Locations\nIE\nUK\nSG\nAU\nUS\nPL\nConstruction Cameras\nCamera Specs\nProjects\nPricing\nTutorials\nBlog\nResources\nE-books\nCase Studies\nReality Capture\nSitemap\nProductivity\nSoftware Integrations\nProject Management\nMarketing\nA.I. for Construction\nAbout\nTerms & Conditions\nGDPR compliance\nTrust Center\nAbout\nContact Us\nCareers\nTestimonials\nPartners\nBecome An Installer\nFind An Installer\nFeatures\nTime-lapse\nLive View\nRecordings\nGate Report\nX-Ray\nBIM Integration\nDrones in Construction\nProgress Photos\nZoom\nCompare Tool\nMark-up Tool\nGoogle Play\n \nApple Store\n\n \nWhatsApp\n \nGithub\n \nLinkedin\n \nTwitter\n \nFacebook\n \nVimeo\n \nYoutube\n \nInstagram"

Our clients were able to establish whether or not protocol was followed using the recordings feature of our platform. \n\nRegardless of whether your site is currently operational or not, it is still important to ensure that everything is safe and secure. Having a live view of your construction site allows you to carry out daily checks remotely. \n\nCollaboration\n\nConstruction projects involve multiple stakeholders, so effective communication is now more important than ever. What and how you communicate plays a significant role in how productive your team can be when working from home. So if you can share updates to stakeholders with an image or video, then do. Communicating with a visual reference translates your message in a much more effective way. \n\nCapturing The Story \n\nAs a result of this pandemic, we have seen some of the most impressive turn arounds on construction projects for the healthcare sectors. The hard work behind these projects is something worth being captured and recognised. \n\nIn Ireland, the HSE has turned an exhibition centre in Dublin into a temporary hospital in order to be prepared in the instance of a surge of COVID-19 patients within Irish hospitals.\n\nProposed layout out of hospital beds in HSE isolation facility.\n\nSimilarly in the UK, the NHS is working to transform areas of the Royal Hospital London into an intensive care unit for COVID-19 patients.\n\nWe are proudly working with the HSE in Ireland and the NHS in the UK to tell these stories. \n\nSocial Distancing\n\nConstruction cameras are playing a key role in reducing the number of visitors on site. Our clients now include Evercam in their daily online meetings to discuss what is happening on site. If your site is still operating, cameras can be used to ensure compliance with social distancing measures. \n\nAs we slowly return to normality, Evercam will play a key role in ensuring social distancing practices are continued on-site. Social distancing is not just about not going to site, it’s also about minimising moving around the site. Evercam helps you to make decisions without walking across the site.  This makes it easier for those who have to be moving around the site.\n\nTake a look at how Sisk used Evercam to ensure social distancing was practiced on site pre-lock down.\n\nIn the past, regular site visits were a vital part of daily life within the construction industry whereas now the focus will shift to keeping as many people off sites as possible. Site visits will still be necessary sometimes, Evercam helps to make sure these visits are made at the right time, and only when necessary.\n\nWe are fully operational at Evercam, if you are interested in learning more about how our customers are using Evercam or wish to have a camera installed on your site, please get in touch.\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nFaith Tangara\n\nConstruction Writer\nDate : 28-03-2022\n   \nFixed Position Cameras vs PTZ – Which Construction Camera Is Right For Your Jobsite\n\nWith the digital transformation that is taking place across different sectors, the construction industry has not been left behind. Various construction companies have embraced new approaches, tools, and data-centric strategies to improve the outcomes of projects. With the overall aim to reduce costs, time and minimize risks at job sites, adopting digital ways of operations at the site can go a long way to improve efficiency and deliver projects on time. One of the modes of incorporating digitalization is through reality capture. \n\nReality capture is the process of quickly and efficiently recording the conditions of the project using construction cameras in order to gain the most accurate interpretation of the project and represent the closest portrayal of reality. Construction progress can be captured either using PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) cameras or fixed position cameras. Construction cameras have become the most common form of reality capture on job sites. These cameras are used to improve security,  enforce policies and procedures and provide visual project documentation of everything that happens on a project, helping project managers stay on schedule and on budget. They can improve collaboration between key stakeholders while reducing the need to physically visit the Jobsite.  \n\nAs the name suggests, PTZ cameras use motors that allow them to pan, tilt, and zoom in and out of a preset location. One can operate them remotely to monitor wide open areas that require a 360-degree view. \n\nFixed-position cameras are set up stationarily to capture the activities of a set location over a given time. Although these types of cameras are immobile, it is the ability to capture events in real-time that give them an upper hand as construction cameras. With a number of options and suppliers, selecting the right construction camera can be challenging. This is because the features of the construction camera are not only important but also the functionality. \n\nHere are some of the differences between these two cameras that are commonly used on job sites: \n\nFixed position Cameras Over PTZ cameras\nCoverage Area\n\nWith the advancements of image resolution in fixed IP CCTV cameras, single or multiple fixed cameras can provide better coverage at a lower cost than a single PTZ camera. High-resolution fixed cameras can be configured to allow for digital zoom and set to cover the same area as a PTZ camera. On the upper hand, fixed cameras are never repositioned out of place, thereby providing multiple angles and views of any incidents that may occur on-site. \n\nFixed Position vs PTZ Camera Field of View\nBlind Spots\n\nTypically, a PTZ camera covers a larger area than a fixed position camera because it can rotate through different coverage. However, with this movement, there are high chances of blind spots as the PTZ camera rotates and this provides incoherent data capture. A fixed position camera has no risk of any blind spots but rather offers reality capture of the entire site activities. Future references can be made from reality capture without the worry of missing captures.\n\nInstallation\n\nDue to the complexity of the PTZ camera and its ability to move around, it requires precision during installation so that the camera can be fully utilized. On the contrary, a fixed camera can be easily installed on-site without the worry of any potential damages to the camera during installation. \n\nCost-Effective\n\nPTZ Cameras are expensive compared to fixed-position cameras in terms of both hardware and installation costs. Installation of fixed cameras is highly cost-effective compared to PTZ cameras\n\nPicture quality\n\nFixed-position cameras produce high-resolution images and have a zooming ability beyond 18X the normal basic zooming level. PTZ cameras are unable to capture high-resolution images due to the mobility capability of the cameras  \n\nDigital Zoom\n\nToday’s construction cameras have complex multi-function systems and optional components. These components make these cameras have different price points and ROI to the customer. The fixed position camera with 101 degree, lens or field of view has a digital zoom feature. Digital Zoom uses the camera’s processor to crop into the center of the photo, capturing fewer pixels, then scaling up the smaller image and stretching out those fewer pixels to get the photo resolution back to its original size. On the other hand, the downside of the PTZ camera with its optical zoom feature is that once a user zooms in optically, the rest of the view is not captured and any important occurrence off-frame can be easily missed. This is why digital zooms to fixed position cameras have the most opportunity to recuperate costs.\n\nEssentially, fixed cameras are advantageous since they provide reality capture that is also handy during the construction progress and help with project management\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nBook a demo\nContact\n\n6-7 Granby Row, Dublin 1, Ireland\n+353 1 919 4500\n\n\n\nOther Locations\nIE\nUK\nSG\nAU\nUS\nPL\nConstruction Cameras\nCamera Specs\nProjects\nPricing\nTutorials\nBlog\nResources\nE-books\nCase Studies\nReality Capture\nSitemap\nProductivity\nSoftware Integrations\nProject Management\nMarketing\nA.I. for Construction\nAbout\nTerms & Conditions\nGDPR compliance\nTrust Center\nAbout\nContact Us\nCareers\nTestimonials\nPartners\nBecome An Installer\nFind An Installer\nFeatures\nTime-lapse\nLive View\nRecordings\nGate Report\nX-Ray\nBIM Integration\nDrones in Construction\nProgress Photos\nZoom\nCompare Tool\nMark-up Tool\nGoogle Play\n \nApple Store\n\n \nWhatsApp\n \nGithub\n \nLinkedin\n \nTwitter\n \nFacebook\n \nVimeo\n \nYoutube\n \nInstagram"

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nFaith Tangara\n\nConstruction Writer\nDate : 28-03-2022 Last Modified Date : 28-04-2023\n   \nThe Not-So-Secret World of Sustainability\n\nThe future of business in all industries—and especially construction—rests solely on the strength of sustainability efforts. Achieving sustainability involves everyone. It requires everyone to think differently about our lives, the economy, and the world. It means making a transition in how we view the environment and want to improve our quality of life today and for the future. Sustainability requires innovation, technology, and people.\n\nSustainability, Defined\n\nMerriam-Webster defines sustainable as relating to or being a method of harvesting or using a resource so that the resource is not depleted or permanently damaged. Simply put, I define it as environmentally sound living without compromising the needs of future generations. So, if that is sustainability in general, then sustainable construction is environmentally friendly practices across the project lifecycle.\n\nThere are two big ways to be able to do this. For one, builders can make sure the buildings and homes themselves are sustainable, so the building owner or homeowner consumes less energy in the lifecycle of the structure. At the same time, contractors need to ensure processes at the jobsite are as sustainable as possible—something we will explore in-depth throughout this blog.\n\nThe Need for Sustainability in Construction\n\nToday, more than ever there is a growing need for sustainability in construction. We all know C&D (construction and demolition) are some of the biggest contributors to waste in industry. In fact, numbers from the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), suggest 600 million tons of C&D debris were generated in the United States in 2018, which is more than twice the amount of generated municipal solid waste.\n\nFurther, demolition represents more than 90% of total C&D debris generation, while construction represents less than 10%. Only roughly 455 million tons of debris were directed to next use, while just under 145 million tons were sent to landfills.\n\nWaste is simply one example too. According to the UN Environment Programme 2021 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction, in 2015, the construction and operation of buildings was responsible for 38% of global energy-related CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions. By 2020, CO2 emissions in the sector had fallen an estimated 10%, a level not seen since 2007. This decline was driven largely by reduced energy demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also by continued efforts to decarbonize the power sector.\n\nSustainable construction\nThe Role of Construction Cameras in Sustainability\n\nConstruction companies need to demonstrate a more efficient way in managing risk to be more cost-effective as they digitize their businesses. It will not be a separation of business, but part and parcel of everyday business. Going forward, the construction industry needs to leverage technology to be more sustainable on the jobsite.\n\nCase in point: construction cameras. Capturing and processing data from construction jobsites is one way to improve operational sustainability. Reality capture makes it possible for operations to understand the impact of construction on the surrounding environment and a plan for proper waste management. Consider the example of AI (artificial intelligence), which can track the time difference between entry and exit of the vehicles. Another instance is the integration with BIM (building information modeling), which can enable better, faster, and less wasteful project delivery. And these are just a handful of examples. All in all, technology can reduce energy consumption and waste across the project lifecycle.\n\nLiving Lab: Project Sustainability\n\nGoing forward, construction companies will also have to build more sustainable homes and buildings. To help, Project Sustainability: Leveraging Tech to Build a Greener Home is designed to be a model for sustainable, resilient, and efficient residential home building practices.\n\nThis individual project will incorporate the most advanced products and systems from leading manufacturers and technology companies to demonstrate and educate both industry and consumers alike about how we can create a sustainable, clean, and green future for all homes and future communities for which we live, thrive, and prosper.\n\nThe future is sustainable—and those that realize it now are going to be more successful and profitable in the months ahead.\n\n*    *    * \n\nPeggy Smedley\n\nPeggy Smedley is an award-winning journalist and technology expert.

    "url": "https://evercam.io/blog/construction-camera-bim-integration-why-you-need-this-technology-for-your-next-project/",
    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nFaith Tangara\n\nConstruction Writer\nDate : 30-03-2022\n   \nConstruction Camera BIM Integration – Why you need this technology for your next project\n\nConstruction cameras are continuously becoming an important reality capture source on job sites in recent years. Not only are such cameras now needed for time-lapse videos and project management but the innovative BIM integration feature is now being used to verify that projects are on schedule by comparing real-time footage vs the proposed design.\n\nEvercam Construction Camera software integrates with BIM enabling users to overlay 3D renderings over construction camera images to compare the planned & actual construction status. Different project stakeholders can benefit from this feature by superimposing the BIM model and being able to follow through with the progress of each milestone. \n\nWHY INTEGRATE YOUR BIM MODEL?\nAll in one platform:\n\nIntegrating a BIM model within Evercam provides real-time video & virtual models that are synchronized in an all-in-one visualization. This provides real-time visibility for all project team members involved, indisputable progress data, and better alignment amongst stakeholders throughout the life cycle of the project. \n\nProgress Verification:\n\nWith BIM integration, users can identify whether the project is being built on time or off the critical path schedule. The stakeholders can identify the milestones achieved or delayed versus the actual progress. By combining this visualization with Evercam’s project management features and full video recording, it is possible to also tell the reason behind progress delays e.g weather delays. \n\nCost Saving:\n\nCompanies that integrate BIM on cameras cut their expenditure price points by saving money on BIM licenses. 3D modeling platform user licenses are expensive. However, Evercam users have unlimited user access to the BIM feature and more people can view the BIM model and can reference live view footage compared to the number of users that BIM would allow at one given time. Allowing more of the project team to share and interact with a BIM model than before.\n\nVisual Update:\n\nThe integration allows users to switch between the BIM model and as-built progress. With this, team members can track progress and communicate progress and any change orders. \n\nReduced Site Visits:\n\nBIM integration on construction cameras bridges the gap between what is designed at the office and what is built on site. The integration feature gives everyone a clear update of the status of the project at any point in time. With the stakeholders being kept informed, site visits are greatly reduced. \n\nWin more business:\n\nConstruction companies can win more business from clients by utilizing the BIM model to showcase project progress and by providing a timeline of completed works.\n\nBIM model integrated with Evercam’s timelapse cameras\n\n\nWith the above reasons, some of the project team members that benefit from the BIM feature extensively include:\n\nProject Managers and Superintendents:  With the visual update from the BIM feature, it is easier for project managers and superintendents to compare the BIM schedule to the live view than reading a Project Schedule and comparing it to the live view. \nBIM Engineers: Since the BIM model can be overlaid over the actual project and check on the progress, BIM engineers utilize this tool to ensure that construction is executed as per the design. BIM engineers also ensure that BIM guidelines are respected throughout construction.\nQuantity Surveyors: To achieve optimum prices for each element of the project, the quantity surveyor can also overlay the BIM model over the ongoing project and carry out valuation for the works done versus the work yet to be completed. This enables the QS to advise on costs and/ or predict future expenditures. \nBid Managers/ Contractors – They use this feature to show they have been on or ahead of the schedule. They can also use this to explain any reasons for delays in case the need arises. \nChief Information Officer – A CIO uses this feature to manage and showcase the formulating changes in the BIM Digital twin to enhance communications of actual vs planned vs changes with the project.\n\nWe believe the integration of 4D models and reality capture will enable lean construction practices and more productive construction sites, along with better asset management. We know this future of construction practices and are excited to be part of the changing landscape. \n\nTo add BIM to your construction camera, get in touch with us today\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Where The Difference Lies\n\nBIM (Building Information Modeling) is a new generation of architecture and building design software that provides a 3D digital representation of the project to be constructed so that it can be visualized in realistic conditions and used for further calculations. Digital Twin, on the other hand, refers to an integrated digital model of both the physical asset and its surrounding environment. It’s often described as a “living twin” because it updates in real time as changes occur and enables predictive maintenance.\n\nBIM and digital twin share the same goal of creating a common, shared platform for design, specification, construction and use of buildings, incorporating various information systems that are typically maintained by providers. However, there are a number of key differences between BIM and digital twin.\n\nPerception/Fusion:\n\nThe purpose of BIM is to create a 3D model that includes everything required for design or construction. This includes 3 material layers (construction, foundation, insulation and other building materials) that are typically represented with different polygonal mesh-based models for each level of the application. The end result is a solid model that can be used by 2D and 3D drawing tools as well as computers equipped with the appropriate software. Digital Twin represents only the physical asset at its component level but does omit all possible design information. It is the combination of all meaningful information and data that is relevant to a digital twin. While BIM is perceived as a tool for design and construction, Digital Twin is a tool for operation.\n\nBIM View combines real time, high-quality footage with a digital twin.\n\nScope:\n\nIn terms of scope, BIM refers to the digital representation of objects according to building design requirements. BIM is intended for collaboration and visualization during the design and construction phases, serving as a digital record post-construction. On the other hand, a Digital Twin comprises every aspect of an organization’s asset and its environment as well as relevant processes (manufacturing/operations), that can be digitally modeled. Digital Twins are intended for operations & maintenance.\n\nConstruction Lifecycle:\n\nBIM is predominantly used in the as-built stage of construction. The use of BIM makes it very easy to preserve a model that reflects the final building geometry and data. It consists of all the changes that have been implemented in the building during and post-construction. This model can be preserved for years and be utilized for maintenance of the building, design changes, renovation, etc. Looking at the digital twin life cycle, as the construction phases proceed, different types of data are captured continuously (including data from sensors and monitoring devices). The captured data can be combined with BIM data to build a digital replica of the construction site i.e. “digital twin” that is updated in real-time with new data. Over the course of construction, project managers can use the digital twin platform to gain a multi-dimensional view of the performance of the construction site. The platform can also be used to predict trends, detect risks, and optimize project schedules.\n\nEven after the construction phase, you can use the 3D model to efficiently manage and maintain the building. For example, you can use the model for developing an annual maintenance plan or to easily locate parts that require maintenance. Additionally, you can simulate and calculate any changes to the installations in the 3D model before applying them.\n\nDatabase:\n\nBIM is prescriptive. BIM answers questions about the elements of a building maintaining a database of the functional and physical properties of elements. For example: What is the thickness of the wall? How many walls are used in the building e.t.c. A digital twin is descriptive. It maintains a database of real-time activities addressing queries such as every status change reported for all activities of the project and who reported them; Issues and obstacles faced during the construction process and who resolved them at what point of time and so on.\n\nBIM Compare tool on past project. Source Evercam Time lapse cameras\n\nThese smart platforms both represent a digital reconstruction of a building. What makes them different is the capacity in which they support it. BIM helps keep design-build on time, under budget, and true to form. Digital twins help a well-designed building meet and exceed its intended purpose. Construction companies are also getting smarter with respect to employing tech tools hence making the demand for smart software to support the entire building life cycle high. BIM and digital twins combine to answer this demand, each serving an important role before, during, and after the build, and to the many purposes, it’ll serve throughout its lifetime.\n\nTo discover more about how Evercam can connect with your BIM model and Digital Twin, get in touch with us today.\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

This year, the safety campaign runs over the entire month of October to further spread awareness and drive engagement. Starting on October 10th, the emphasis has been placed on supporting the Lighthouse Club’s Help Inside a Hard Hat initiative. Then, during the next two weeks (17–28), there will be a focus on safety topics, including five days dedicated solely to job-site safety.\n\nIt is everyone’s goal to remain safe and in order to achieve this, communication and connection play a key role. With one of the topics for the Safety Week summit being modern methods of construction, technology like construction cameras remains to be a popular addition to construction site safety measures. Construction cameras ensure and continue to facilitate the connectedness of project team members, which is an integral part of completing a project safely and on time. \n\nConstruction cameras can play a major role in health safety adherence. Accidents on construction sites are almost inevitable and often end up resulting in lawsuits and hefty non-compliance fees as well. However, construction cameras can help regulate safety within job sites and can also provide you with a full video recording of accidents, near misses or other incidents that may happen on a project site.\n\nIdentifying Potential Hazards\n\nSite managers are able to use high-definition construction cameras to monitor site activities and quickly identify any potential hazards in real-time and take immediate action to reduce the risk of harm. Cameras can help identify workers who are adhering to safety policies and regulations and those that could be disrupting the implementation of regulations. In the past, contractors and sub-contractors would have to physically be present at construction sites for monitoring. The ability to review site practices remotely also enables managers to handle two or more sites simultaneously, reducing the number of physical site visits needed, and saving time and money. \n\nTransparency and Better Documentation\n\nThe use of cameras helps in obtaining accurate and real-time information, which can be used for assessment as well as reinforcement of the construction process and employee training. When information is available from the exact moment the accident happened, it makes documentation easier. This information is crucial for generating regular maintenance and safety reports and ensuring the overall safety of employees.\n\nConstruction workers on site. Courtesy: Unsplash\n\nAccountability\n\nThe use of footage from construction cameras helps to tell whether the person in charge of safety regulations was responsible or how they can be held accountable. Construction job site cameras provide high-resolution, panoramic views of an entire construction site 24/7. Round-the-clock monitoring enables contractors to keep an eye on their site at all times. The footage helps deliver a clear picture of what happened and how the situation could have been prevented. This helps in identifying problem cases, which will ultimately improve OSHA regulations at the worksite. Off-site contractors can easily monitor the construction site in real time. \n\nCost Control and Reduce Insurance Premiums \n\nAny damage to the construction equipment or employee injuries can be a huge setback in terms of cost and the progress of a project. Installing construction cameras can help with damage control. Properly maintained surveillance helps limit costs on insurance premiums. In the case of an unfortunate incident, the footage can provide strong evidence for your insurance claim.\n\nEmployee Protection. \n\nDespite advances in construction safety equipment, technology and training, the construction industry continues to face high rates of fatal and nonfatal injuries and accidents among its workers. According to OSHA 1 in 5 deaths among U.S. workers is in the construction industry. US Bureau of Statistics records that of the 42 annual crane-related deaths, around 60% involve a falling object. Construction cameras provide video evidence in case there are any injuries that are a result of neglect in adhering to OSHA regulations. Fatal injuries can be prevented as the concerned authorities are able to react and respond in time. Cameras can create a culture of safety on site. Workers are more likely to follow precautions when they are being monitored. With a well-equipped camera installation, your workforce can rest assured that they are being monitored and therefore protected against any mishaps.\n\nTool For Health and Safety Training.\n\nCamera footage can go a long way to provide insight into training. When trainees see an actual video of an event gone wrong, it becomes more effective than reading a manual on equipment safety. For example, if an accident happened, the footage could help pinpoint its cause. It can serve as a reference when developing interventions to ensure the same incident won’t happen again. Accidents could happen due to the operator not following procedures or not having been adequately trained. This information can also help site managers in coming up with a well-designed training program.\n\nConstruction cameras are already becoming an essential part of HSEQ, health & safety and project management teams’ workflows.

    "title": "How is Digital Disruption Transforming Construction?",
    "url": "https://evercam.io/blog/digital-disruption-in-construction/",
    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nFaith Tangara\n\nConstruction Writer\nDate : 18-05-2022 Last Modified Date : 28-05-2024\n   \nHow is Digital Disruption Transforming Construction?\n\nThe construction industry is poised with a constant challenge for digital transformation to change how projects are delivered, cut costs of executing projects and improve the overall project execution and timeliness. This goes hand in hand with the demand for increased profitability. Every day, around the world, more than 200,000 people are moving into cities.\n\nTo support this influx, cities need to build. Global trends such as increased competition, urbanisation, limited natural resources, and pervasive challenges such as talent access and engagement tend to make construction projects complex to manage and execute.\n\nAs project complexity increases, construction companies must harness the impact of digitisation and technology adoption to execute projects effectively. \n\nAccording to Deloitte analysis of MIT Sloan Management, few construction companies are using technology to not only improve margins but also create new business opportunities. The industry should seriously consider transformational innovation, connectedness and digital technologies to generate cost effective and sustained competitive advantage. \n\nAs technology evolves and is adopted, one of the key components in maintaining or improving construction projects is connectedness. Connectedness in job sites involves visibility on-site and making data available to all members of the project.\n\nCreating dashboards to analytically monitor progress, performance and resource performance, and environmental conditions such as workers’ safety give the team the insights they need to make data-driven decisions. \n\nTechnology In Construction\nReal-time Visibility\n\nIn today’s competitive landscape, construction companies have little to no choice but to leverage current technologies in their business strategy. Innovations in real-time visibility using construction cameras enable remote site monitoring which has proven to increase efficiency and productivity while improving communication.\n\nThe insights that real-time monitoring delivers transform how projects are managed. The visual data collected during the execution phase can significantly influence project outcomes relating to schedule, quality, and safety.\n\nConstruction cameras impact many challenges construction managers face every day such as the need for increased productivity and improved collaboration, while also performing as a tool for site security during and outside of working hours.\n\nTechnology in Construction\nWorker Safety\n\nIn the Internet of Things in construction, these cameras provide high resolution, wide view panoramic views of an entire construction site 24/7. Round-the-clock monitoring enables contractors to keep an eye on their site at all times.\n\nIn the event of an incident, footage gathered by these cameras helps deliver a clear picture of what happened and how the situation could have been prevented. This helps in identifying problem cases, which will ultimately improve OSHA regulations at the worksite.\n\nConstruction cameras provide video evidence in case there are any injuries that are a result of neglect in adhering to OSHA regulations. Fatal injuries can be prevented as the concerned authorities are able to react and respond in time. Cameras can create a culture of safety on site as workers are more likely to follow precautions when they are being monitored.\n\nFleet Management\n\nConstruction teams have now adopted fleet managers as part of their teams to efficiently coordinate vehicle and equipment dispatch to keep construction projects on schedule. With the help of fleet tracking software, managers can find the best routes and send the nearest available drivers to fulfil site requirements.\n\nThis increases the construction company’s ability to respond to urgent changes in site requests and enables them to quickly adapt on the go without delays. Construction cameras have also been integrated with artificial intelligence, such as Evercam’s Gate Report feature which identifies the type of vehicles that enters and exits the site as well as provides the relative data required by project stakeholders. \n\nDynamic Work Planning & Collaboration\n\nInstalling construction cameras breaks through the barriers of project management. Project managers juggle multiple projects at any given time in order to make up for the shortfall of skilled labour.\n\nBeing able to access construction site cameras from any device at any time frees up project managers from having to visit worksites as often and enables them to monitor multiple sites from anywhere that they have an internet connection.\n\nBuilding information Modelling-BIM\n\nUndoubtedly, BIM has become one of the greatest advancements that have taken place within the construction industry in recent years. This element has replaced the need for a blueprint which had to be produced before the start of the project.\n\nWhen an incredibly detailed and interactive 3D model of the intended structure is produced, it brings together all the necessary information about the project in one place. Using BIM methodologies and standards to collaboratively create digital representations of assets, organisations have brought new consistency and efficiency to their design, construction and operation.\n\nBIM has proven itself as a valuable mechanism for connecting information and ideas between different stakeholders. Now, forward-thinking leaders are evolving their BIM outputs beyond design and construction and are finding new ways of deepening the use of collaborative data models in operational strategies through digital twin adoption.\n\nDigital twins allow visualisation, monitoring and optimisation of operational assets, processes and resources by harnessing live data. This provides vital, real-time insights into performance and activity. At its core, is essentially a ‘living’ version of the project or asset view that BIM processes exist to create – able to evolve and transform using real-time data once the asset is in use.\n\nBy adopting digitisation, on a broader, strategic scale, construction firms are given the power to analyze and improve their operating procedures for further increases in efficiency, quality, and consequently, profitability.\n\nConsidering how technology is transforming businesses in every other sector, there is little doubt regarding the fact that it is also transforming construction companies and the sector as a whole.\n\nThus, construction companies need to identify opportunities to disrupt their operations and invest in adopting tech tools through pilot projects to gain the early-adopter advantage.\n\nGet in touch with us to find out more about how our construction cameras are continually disrupting technology in the industry.\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

As the Sales Manager of APAC, he discusses the changing construction markets. He also shares his experiences with new technologies and client engagement in different areas.\n\nHis experience in construction, combining technical knowledge and marketing skills, provides insights into adapting to challenges in the field. Follow through as Fionn shares insights from his career path, highlighting the importance of adaptability and strategic thinking in today’s construction industry.\n\nWhat aspects of the construction industry captivate you most?\n\nI like the industry for its straightforward people and the challenge of big projects. It’s always changing, with lots of different skills and machines. I’m into how varied the skills, machinery, and construction work are.\n\nFrom your perspective what key abilities set apart successful professionals in the construction industry?\n\nThe capacity to get things done efficiently and the ability to navigate through the project complexities without overcomplicating processes. Successful professionals in this industry are those who can execute.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWho has been a significant inspiration in your career?\n\nMy father has been a major inspiration due to his extensive experience in business. Colleagues at Evercam, especially in the early days with Vinnie Quinn and Tammy Bennett, with their wealth of knowledge and support, have also contributed to my professional development.\n\nHow do you handle the challenge of dealing with different construction sectors?\n\nMy strategy revolves around understanding universal issues in construction projects: communication, disputes, safety incident, and health and safety. Regardless of the project type—residential, commercial, or industrial—we emphasize how our solutions streamline the process for everyone involved.\n\nCould you share a moment from your career that had a significant impact?\n\nEarly in my career, a safety incident occurred at a client’s construction site. They urgently needed to understand what happened. Our construction cameras provided the necessary footage for their investigation.\n\nThis experience was eye-opening for me. It showed Evercam technology’s role in ensuring safety and accountability. It emphasized the importance and impact of our high-frame-rate recording in construction.\n\nCould you share with us your career progression within Evercam?\n\nSure thing! I started in the Irish team, honing my skills there. Then, I joined the UK team, where I took on bigger challenges. Now I’m with the APAC team, leading them as Sales Manager.\n\nEach move up the ladder has been a leap in experience and learning. It has been a journey of growing, leading, and getting to know the ins and outs of this industry.\n\nWhat challenges do markets face in adopting new construction technologies?\n\nThe key challenge in adopting new construction technologies is the reluctance to move away from traditional methods. Despite Australia and Singapore’s openness to new technologies, there remains a significant learning curve and the need to overcome initial hesitation.\n\nBalancing the introduction of innovative solutions with existing practices and overcoming the mindset of doing things the ‘old way’ are significant challenges in these markets.\n\nWhat are your hobbies outside of work, and do they influence your professional life?\n\nI’m a big fan of soccer and GAA. It’s not just about staying fit; there’s something about winning, the teamwork, and the thrill of the game that I just love. Interestingly, Evercam sponsors the team I play with, Randwick City FC.\n\nThis involvement in sports has taught me resilience and a competitive edge, which are essential for dealing with professional setbacks and challenges.\n\nEvercam is actually one of the sponsors for the current team I play with, Randwick City FC.\n\nFionn’s insights show that combining market know-how and tech advances can push the construction industry forward. His experiences not only underscore the innovative approach of his work but also highlight the importance of client relationships and strategic thinking in navigating the construction landscape.\n\nAs the industry forges ahead, Fionn’s perspectives reinforce the value of embracing change, leveraging technology, and maintaining a focus on client needs. Fionn’s story stands as a clear example of the extraordinary outcomes that can be achieved through a blend of expertise, forward thinking, and a deep commitment to meeting the evolving demands of the construction industry.

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nFaith Tangara\n\nConstruction Writer\nDate : 07-02-2024 Last Modified Date : 24-04-2024\n   \nVoices of Evercam: Meet Jeffrey Deasy, Global Sales Director – Mission Critical\n\"The key to achieving this kind of growth is to be relentless. Always fighting for the customer and striving to deliver excellence.\"\n\nFrom the hum of engines in the automotive world to the dynamic buzz of the construction industry, Jeff’s career journey is a story of adaptability and ambition. Now as the Global Sales Director of Mission Critical, Jeff reflects on how the global pandemic’s challenges pushed the industry toward remote visibility and management, offering him a way into construction. He has grown in construction, making strategic moves, and ultimately mastered managing the visibility of projects in the mission critical sector.\n\nJeff, can you tell us about your career journey?\n\nCertainly! My career started in the motor trade. This was driven by my family’s mechanical passion in Aerospace and Engineering. I specialised in diagnostics and electronics. I later advanced to management in my early 20s, overseeing operations and sales at a busy south Dublin garage. Fueled by entrepreneurship, I founded a high-end vehicle business, later transitioning to security management, specialising in CCTV for new buildings. This led me through various industries, from security systems to audio-visual corporate communications, until I found my place at Evercam.\n\nI started at Evercam in Irish business development, working closely with co-founder Vinnie to understand the business. Along the way, I found a great growth opportunity and identified the Mission Critical projects as an area that was worth dedicated focus. So I was offered the challenge of business unit lead, focusing on data centers, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors. We built a specialised operations team and soon soon hit a big expansion in the European market in this niche, growing 10x in one year. Our success led me to the role of Global Sales Director, where I now work with Randall, our Chief Revenue Officer. My journey at Evercam has been fascinating and rewarding.\n\nWhat’s the key to achieving such impressive growth?\n\nThe key to achieving this kind of growth is to be relentless. Always fighting for the customer and striving to deliver excellence. Building trust with clients and not letting them down is crucial. This has only been possible by having phenomenal teams across the company. This, coupled with word-of-mouth referrals and establishing a strong reputation in this challenging industry has resulted in our rapid growth.\n\nWhat do you enjoy about working in construction?\n\nI love the diversity of people within the construction industry. I get to build great relationships with people across different sectors within the industry, from electricians on the site to top-level executives. The variety of personalities and backgrounds in construction is fascinating, and I find it rewarding to not only work with such a wide spectrum of people but also learn from them. \n\nHow do you manage multiple stakeholders in complex projects?\n\nWhen it comes to handling such projects with lots of different people involved, our main rule is to always be there for our clients, no matter what time it is. If they need us at 11 PM for a project in the US, we’re on it. And if I don’t have the answer right away, I make sure to find someone on our team who does. This way, we make sure we never let our clients down. Over the years, we’ve built up a really strong operations team that’s great at dealing with mission critical projects and is trained to handle every detail and challenge, ensuring smooth coordination and support for all stakeholders involved.\n\n \n\nHow do you ensure all high standards and meet expectations in mission critical projects?\n\nUnderstanding and adhering to regional legal and security requirements is key. We constantly educate ourselves on security laws and practices in different regions. Evercam is robustly built with encrypted data transmission and secure hardware, ensuring the highest standards of privacy and security. \n\nWhat were the main challenges when you started working with the construction industry?\n\nI found the biggest challenge was developing the new abilities required for remote work and adapting to extensive travel. Formerly, my career had been built on in person relationships and local reach and I had to learn how to bring my skills/experience to build relationships and business remotely. This transition was a steep learning curve but allowed me to connect with a broader range of people globally and I’m glad to see the results of that effort.\n\nWhat’s the most important lesson you’ve learned in your career?\n\nThe biggest lesson has been understanding the impact of a company culture driven by vision and unique leadership. Being part of Evercam’s growth and learning from visionary leaders and colleagues has been invaluable.\n\nWhat are the key factors for project management success in mission critical projects?\n\nEffective communication and real-time visibility are crucial. Avoiding mistakes and disputes through transparency and accountability is key. Our technology helps in spotting problems early and avoiding rework, which is critical given the high penalties for delays on these projects.\n\nWhat are the current challenges and trends in the construction industry, especially in mission critical projects?\n\nOne of the biggest challenges is the limited pool of skilled professionals for the increasing number of projects, especially in the data center and semiconductor sectors. The industry is also facing the need for rapid, efficient project completion to avoid hefty penalties for delays. Technologically, there’s a shift towards incorporating more advanced tools for real-time project monitoring and management to ensure efficiency and avoid costly mistakes.\n\nHow do you balance your high work demands while maintaining a motivated team?\n\nIt’s about keeping a positive attitude and ensuring the team feels supported. We focus on making the best decisions possible quickly and continually moving forward. \n\nIt’s important to avoid dwelling on problems and instead work towards solutions. Keeping the team spirit high, even during challenging times, is crucial.\n\n What’s next for you and Evercam in the coming years?\n\nWe plan to continue our expansion into new markets and further refine our technology to meet the evolving needs of our clients. We’re also looking at forming strategic partnerships to enhance our service offerings and exploring new technologies to stay ahead in the field.\n\nWhat’s been the most impactful moment in your career at Evercam?\n\nSigning Evercam’s first seven-figure enterprise deal was a Eureka moment. It proved we were doing something right, especially when large American companies started choosing us over our established competitors.\n\nWhat specific strategies have you implemented in Evercam for project success?\n\nWe’ve focused on building a robust operations team and improving our hardware to meet the specific needs of mission critical projects. This specialisation and dedication to understanding the unique requirements of our clients have been key to our success.\n\nFinally, what do you find most rewarding about your work in the construction industry?\n\nThe most rewarding aspect is seeing the tangible results of our work – the successful completion of complex projects that have a real impact on society.\n\nBeing a part of creating something lasting and significant, like a major data center or a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, is incredibly fulfilling. It’s also rewarding to see how our technology and efforts help streamline the construction process, reduce errors, and ultimately lead to better outcomes for our clients. The sense of accomplishment and the knowledge that we are contributing to important developments in technology and infrastructure is what drives me and my team every day.\n\nJeff’’s career is a testament to the power of passion, adaptability, and relentless learning. He’s a true inspiration, proving that with curiosity, determination, and foresight, you can not only navigate but also shape the future of an industry.\n\nConnect With Jeff\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Trailer One, Inc broke ground in the spring of 2022. The move to have a new and larger location was to accommodate inventory demands for its growing customer base.\n\nThis job site had 2 construction cameras installed on site which facilitated efficient communication amongst project team members. Even though the goal of the company was to have security cameras, the construction cameras which have been integrated with Procore added up to provide seamless project management. They were able to easily check the progress of the project against the plan of work. \n\nThe team also used our Snapmail feature to send images weekly to their sales team to then share with customers or providers to update them on the project. The availability of construction cameras on site greatly reduced the number of trips for site visits as was the case before. \n\nTrailer One.

The ability to share the live stream with others gave us the ability to share with the bank inspector to avoid travel & inspection charges to the loan.  We were able to share with engineers, excavators and builders to confirm deliveries of materials and confirm the daily activity of the workers on site. “ Brad Thomas – General Manager- Trailer One\n\nThis project used the gate report feature in project documentation and logistics.

By integrating advanced modeling techniques and real-time data, we help streamline decision-making processes and improve project outcomes,” says Oussama.\n\nHow has integrating different technologies improved real-time monitoring at Evercam?\n\n“One of our most exciting challenges,” Oussama shares, “was finding a way to integrate the Drone app with the 360 app. This integration created a new dimension in how we manage and visualize construction projects, allowing for a seamless flow of information and enhanced real-time decision-making.”\n\n“We also use drones and AI to create real-time models of construction sites, allowing project managers to see the progress remotely. It’s about bringing clarity and precision to a traditionally unpredictable field,” he explains.\n\nWhat does a typical day look like for a software engineer at Evercam?\n\nOussama’s typical day involves a blend of coding, team meetings, and strategy sessions.\n\n“Each day is different, but it always revolves around how we can use technology to solve real problems,” he describes. Ensuring the security and privacy of data is a critical part of his daily responsibilities, especially as Evercam handles relevant project information.\n\nAs a team leader, Oussama balances his technical knowledge with leadership responsibilities. “Leading a team isn’t just about managing projects. It’s about inspiring your team, understanding their strengths and weaknesses, and guiding them to achieve their best,” he notes. This approach has helped him foster a collaborative and innovative team environment.\n\nBack in Algeria, Oussama was among the founding members of Team Open Mind, a collective of computer science students committed to the principles of ‘learn, practice, share.‘ This foundational experience not only shaped his approach to knowledge and collaboration but also deeply influenced his leadership style.\n\nHow does Evercam ensure the security and scalability of its software solutions?\n\nTo address security and scalability, his team implements rigorous testing and updates. “We ensure that all data handled by Evercam is secured against breaches and that our systems can scale with the growing demands of our projects,” he elaborates.\n\n“At Evercam, we are vigilant about maintaining the integrity and security of our systems,” explains Oussama. “This means keeping all systems, from browsers to operating systems, updated with the latest security patches. Regularly, we conduct penetration tests—essentially trying to hack our own system to identify any vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.”\n\nAny exciting updates to look out for?\n\nWith many successful projects already, he is now working on integrating project management tools such as P6, and Microsoft projects into the Evercam platform. This development aims to incorporate the project schedule and Gantt charts directly into Evercam’s timeline. Such integration will allow for a more streamlined and precise visualization of project timelines and improve the overall management and tracking of construction projects.\n\nOusamma is also excited about the potential of AI and machine learning to further transform the construction industry. “The future is about smart integration of technology—using AI to predict project challenges before they arise, enhancing safety, and ensuring resource efficiency,” he projects.\n\nVisit our website for the latest updates, exclusive offers, and valuable insights.\n\nLearn more\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

    "url": "https://evercam.io/blog/why-would-a-quantity-surveyor-use-a-construction-timelapse-camera/",
    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nFaith Tangara\n\nConstruction Writer\nDate : 31-01-2022 Last Modified Date : 25-05-2024\n   \n5 Reasons Why A Quantity Surveyor needs a Construction Time-Lapse Camera\nImportance of Construction Cameras To Quantity Surveyors\n\nIt is no debate that any construction project that desires to put control measures with regards to cost, time and material must employ a quantity surveyor. The role of a quantity surveyor varies from one construction site to another and will cover areas like formation of contract, forecasting the cost of projects and respective cash flow, collating maintenance manuals of the project, generating valuations for the work done to date, and overseeing the payment of the subcontractors. \n\nThese responsibilities come with its fair challenges of accuracy of data from the job site activities. In order to facilitate ease of undertaking their roles, it is important for contractors working in tandem with quantity surveyors to introduce the right tools to capture as much data from their site as possible. Visual documentation plays an important role in establishing variations in costs on site, such as deliveries, disputes and muck away costs. Advancements in construction cameras technology now provide quantity surveyors with a tool that captures every moment of the construction process that can be used to support their work..\n\nHere are 5 reasons why quantity surveyors need to use construction cameras in their day to day activities:\nConstruction professionals in a job site.\n5 REASONS WHY QS NEED CONSTRUCTION CAMERAS \n1. Preventing Liability Lawsuits\n\nDisputes are inevitable in any construction project. The installation of construction cameras ensures that the activities of the site are visually documented. In case any claims arise from the contractor that are post dated, the quantity surveyor is able to verify such claims by going back to the recorded clips of the said day and time to ascertain before raising/lowering the value for works done and charging the client. \n\nEvercam has designed a tool that quantity surveyors use for this purpose. The X-ray tool feature enables one to be able to scan the image and make a comparison of the current status of the project against a past selected date. This visual documentation also helps the client save money as there will be no cases of false claims. \n\n2. Extended overview- Ease of valuation of projects\n\nOne of the main functions of the contractor’s quantity surveyor is to ensure that payment for works done on site are timely and paid in full. For most contractors, interim valuations  and certificates form their only source of income, from which they fund the whole of their building operation. In general, building contracts provide within their conditions regular and timely payments to the contractor. This includes the physical measurement of the work on the site and materials delivered. The valuation for interim certificates should be made as accurately as is reasonably possible, and the contractor is entitled under the terms of the contract to the full value of work executed on site, less a specified retention sum.\n\nThis particular QS role has had its own share of challenges following the ‘new norm’ of operating in the pandemic. Such a challenge as ensuring little to no human contact as per the covid-19 regulations affects physical measurement of the works on site. With installation of construction cameras, the QS is provided with an extended overview of the construction progress. \n\nEvercam construction cameras provide a measuring tool feature which eases the work of a QS as they are now able to take measurements remotely. This also helps the QS interact with all of their projects without the need of going to the site in person. The QS is also able to quickly calculate materials which will need to be ordered and quantify an approximate amount by using the measuring tool feature that is integrated in the construction timelapse cameras.\n\n3. Prevent loss of time and materials \n\nOne of the key concerns of a developer is ensuring that the desired building is constructed within budget and on time. The quantity surveyor is responsible for monitoring and controlling costs and use of materials throughout the duration of a construction project. Installing a construction camera on site goes a long way to contribute to achieving this goal. Using the Gate Report feature as provided by Evercam construction cameras, the QS is able to tell the quantity of earthworks done as per a particular date, is able to tell the type of vehicles that enter and exit the site and what material has been brought on site. This helps the QS to calculate the amount of material used so far and how much more may be needed as per the projections in the bill of quantities. With the use of construction cameras, the QS is also able to control costs through remote site monitoring of deliveries of materials and therefore no false claims on quantities can be made. \n\n4. Budget Tracking \n\nA quantity surveyor is the consultant in charge of the budget. With the help of construction cameras installed, the quantity surveyor is provided with a systematic way of overseeing the project and the risk that may arise to affect the construction budget. Evercam construction cameras provide recording in high-resolution images of the construction site progress. These cameras can digitally zoom upto 18-times beyond the basic zoom level and be able to capture every detail in your project.  This enables the QS to identify any potential risks as early as possible before they become major factors that can become additional to the final cost of a project.\n\n5. Monitoring Progress\n\nQuantity surveyors are key personnel in monitoring the progress of the construction project as well as ensuring the right construction practice is put in place. In the case of any variations and modification of initial design, this will affect the cost of the project. The QS ensures that the information provided by BIM is consistent with the design. Construction cameras that have BIM integration makes it easier for the QS to monitor consistency of design or ensure that any changes are reflected in all associated contract documents, as well as the respective cost changes. \n\nConclusion.\n\nThe reasons highlighted above are just but a few of the many that clearly show the essence of camera installation in construction sites. The construction cameras facilitate the roles of the quantity surveyor on site and therefore contribute to the achievement of the desired goal of completing a project in time, within cost estimates and with minimal wastage of materials provided. \n\nIf you are interested in learning more about how your team can benefit from using a construction camera on your next project, please contact us today.\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nFaith Tangara\n\nConstruction Writer\nDate : 10-02-2022 Last Modified Date : 18-02-2022\n   \nHow Visual Documentation Helps In Construction Dispute Resolution.\nVisual documentation & dispute resolution\nIntroduction \n\nThe construction industry is a diverse industry with increasingly complex types of projects that are always evolving not only in design but also in methods of construction. With these complexities, one major constant in every project is disputes. Disputes in construction projects have become quite a common feature and if not resolved as soon as they have arisen they can lead to delays in the stipulated schedule of construction projects, resulting in claims that require lawsuit intervention, loss of time and money. Statistics from the 2021 Global Construction Disputes Report published by Arcadis – The global average value of disputes increased to $54.26 million (US) and 13.4 months to reach resolution. Some of the common causes of disputes in construction projects include; poor project management, variations and changes that are not properly communicated, weather factors that affect construction progress etc. In order to amicably settle such disputes, it is important to have proof that supports any claims. This is where visual documentation plays an important role in dispute mitigation and/or resolution. \n\nCause of Construction disputes\nCommunication/ Variations\n\nIt is common for construction projects to have variations. These variations may be caused by factors such as extreme weather conditions, site conditions, change in the scope of work, etc. Such variations change the schedule of work, quantity of materials used and in some cases the quality of work. Good communication of such variations is crucial to delivering a successful construction project. When communication among stakeholders breaks down or is mishandled, it can lead to delays, accidents, costly rework, and eventually construction disputes amongst the parties. .\n\nProject Management\n\nPoor project management leads to project failure. If a project is not managed properly, there will be ripple effects in terms of cost and the schedule. These effects lead to construction disputes between the client and the contractor since the contractor has to pay for liquidated damages, pay for the plant and equipment for the extra days beyond the set practical completion date. \n\nConstruction quality  \n\nThe construction process has to follow the specifications in the contract documents. If not, then the quality of the building will be poor and with defects. Such matters that arise due to failure of the contractor following the specifications lead to disputes between the parties. \n\nLack of Proper Documentation. \n\nFailure to keep tabs of all relevant documentation during the construction progress can lead to disputes. A site manager is in charge of proper documentation of all people that enter the site every other day, all materials and their respective quantities that are brought or removed from a construction site. Reference is always made to these documents in case a contractor raises any claims that a contractor. \n\nThese factors and many others may lead to construction disputes. These disputes are not easily predictable, almost impossible to completely avoid, and in most cases, challenging to prove. This is why visual documentation of job site activities is important. They say that a photo is worth 1,000 words; how much more a video? \n\nIn the age of technological advancement, the construction industry cannot be left behind. Documenting construction activities has to be evolved from manual to automated. Automated visual documentation using a construction camera provides more operational value not only through time-lapse videos but also progress sharing. This is achieved through \n\ncombined advancements in cellular connectivity, solar power, artificial intelligence and through research & development which our teams did to achieve this vision.\n\nEvercam construction cameras document every second of construction site activity in 4k video, and provide project management tools that make it easy for customers to find important job-site information to solve problems thereby preventing disputes. Whether it’s an argument between owner and contractor over contractual obligations, the GC and architect over design errors, or an argument with your subcontractors over payment for work completed – conflict is hard to avoid.\n\nHow much time and money did your company spend over the last year resolving disputes on your projects?  \n\nNow consider those figures across the global space – a Global Construction Dispute study recently published by Arcadis found that the global average value of disputes increased to $54.26 million and took an average of 14.2 months to resolve. \n\nWhen disputes are not resolved efficiently, the potential negative impacts cannot be understated – delays in the construction process, large financial losses, and possibly even large-scale legal action which can harm the reputation of the company as a whole. \n\nConstruction Workers Comparing Notes At a Jobsite\n\nHowever, there are a lot of moving pieces in construction, and disputes between project stakeholders are to some extent unavoidable. Here are some of the ways our customers have used Evercam to solve these problems quickly\n\n1 – Recording in full video. \n\nEverything that happens in a construction site is recorded in high resolution and stored in the cloud for future reference. Speaking with one of our clients who was served with a claim on faulty equipment, this is what they had to say about this feature “An equipment manufacturer submitted a damage claim stating that we were responsible for the tire damage on a boom lift that we rented for 4 days 40 days prior. I used a zoomed-in video Video Recording of the day the boom lift was dropped off and drew a circle on the tire with the Edit Tool proving that it was damaged before it ever arrived on the project site”.\n\nIn another scenario, damage was done by a vehicle to the sidewalk and the city wanted to fine a client over $10K in damages. The footage from Evercam was used as evidence to prove that the client was not responsible for the damage and avoided paying the fine. Thanks to Evercam providing a digital archive, this client was able to save a lot of money that they would have incurred in lose\n\n2- Having the right data as evidence\n\nAnother client who was facing overcharging on material billing stated that, “We contracted an excavator to remove an unknown amount of contaminated soil from a project site that previously was an old paint factory. They were charging us by truckload, which can be difficult to keep track of manually. When I got the bill, it seemed a bit high, so I used Evercam’s Gate Report to generate a photographic report of all tipping trucks in/out that week and cross referenced it with the bill. Turns out they ‘accidentally’ overcharged us by 12 truckloads, approximately $10,000, and corrected the bill once I sent the pdf report.”\n\n3 – Proactively Identify & Mitigate Potential Issues\n\nWith the use of construction cameras, one is able to identify any potential issues and mitigate or otherwise avoid a dispute. In one of the job-sites, the cameras captured a glass wall smashed and came tumbling down. The window smashed because it was badly fitted, and this was identified before handover so avoided a potentially costly claim. The window fitting subcontractor then had to check & refit multiple panes.  This would have been disputed without the few seconds of Evercam evidence.\n\n4 – Communicate Issues and Change Orders Fast \n\nWith the use of Live View feature on the construction cameras, one is able to remotely monitor construction projects, the stakeholders are provided with 24/7 visibility and are able to communicate change orders faster compared to physically visiting the site first. This results in less delays that may end up causing any form of disputes. \n\nConclusion.\n\nDisputes are part and parcel of the construction process. There will always be an individual arguing that something was done poorly or not done at all, and it’s not a matter of if but when. Of course, there are specific causes and triggers for a dispute that can be avoided from the get-go, such as reducing unpredictability on the job site and making everything as clear as possible, while having contingency plans in place should something go awry, communicating effectively to reduce the rate of disputes occurring, and keeping clear and easily accessible information regarding the state and quality of the work on the ground. Should a dispute arise, there are ways to manage that, such as having clear security records and on-site monitoring, taking advantage of the newest technology in construction, facilitating and clarifying communication on-site and off-site and of course, having clear plans ready from the start to keep everything in check.\n\nInterested to discover more ways that Evercam Construction Cameras can help you during your next project?

A BIM provides users with the planned project schedule and the live camera feed shows users the reality; integrating the two conveys the feeds indicates the status of the project by comparing where the project should be versus where it is.\n\nThe latest update to our BIM Integration feature is the ability to easily identify project milestones using the calendar. Previously, when using the BIM feature, our customers would have to use two different systems to view project milestones. The feature enables customers to identify the milestones on the BIM timeline by highlighting key dates with blue circles on the calendar.\n\nBIM model integrated with Evercam’s timelapse cameras\n\nSo why add BIM to your Evercam camera? \n\nThe BIM Compare feature allows the customer to track progress and quality by comparing real-time footage of the project ‘as-built’ with the BIM model as designed. \n\nVerification: verify that your project is on-time by comparing real-time footage to the BIM model, or fast forward to see where your project should be in two weeks. \nCollaboration: work with multiple teams by adding unlimited users to your camera or by sharing a time-lapse image or video. Ensure everyone has a clear update of the project status at any point in time.\nCommunicate: connecting these two data sources give users the full picture of their project status, enabling them to communicate effective, actionable information to project stakeholders. \n\nTo add BIM to your construction camera, get in touch with us today.\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nBook a demo\nContact\n\n6-7 Granby Row, Dublin 1, Ireland\n+353 1 919 4500\n\n\n\nOther Locations\nIE\nUK\nSG\nAU\nUS\nPL\nConstruction Cameras\nCamera Specs\nProjects\nPricing\nTutorials\nBlog\nResources\nE-books\nCase Studies\nReality Capture\nSitemap\nProductivity\nSoftware Integrations\nProject Management\nMarketing\nA.I. for Construction\nAbout\nTerms & Conditions\nGDPR compliance\nTrust Center\nAbout\nContact Us\nCareers\nTestimonials\nPartners\nBecome An Installer\nFind An Installer\nFeatures\nTime-lapse\nLive View\nRecordings\nGate Report\nX-Ray\nBIM Integration\nDrones in Construction\nProgress Photos\nZoom\nCompare Tool\nMark-up Tool\nGoogle Play\n \nApple Store\n\n \nWhatsApp\n \nGithub\n \nLinkedin\n \nTwitter\n \nFacebook\n \nVimeo\n \nYoutube\n \nInstagram"

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nFaith Tangara\n\nConstruction Writer\nDate : 10-03-2022\n   \nHow Can Construction Cameras Help Boost Construction Sustainability?\n\nSustainable construction means using renewable and recyclable materials when building new structures, as well as reducing energy consumption and waste. The primary goal of sustainable construction is to reduce the industry’s impact on the environment.\n\nLike many other industries, construction is now under increasing pressure to be more environmentally sound and socially responsible.\n\nSolar power systems play a big role in sustainable construction\n\nAs an industry, it contributes 11% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions and its current volume of natural resource utilisation is not sustainable. This clearly shows that the construction industry faces significant challenges in reducing its environmental footprint.\n\nClimate change, resource consumption, and water management are all environmental issues that must be carefully considered when working towards sustainability in construction.\n\nConstruction can also result in hazardous waste, and the improper disposal of such waste can result in pollution that affects not only the environment, but also the health of people living in that area.\n\nIn bid to achieve sustainability in construction, as per the Code for Sustainable Homes and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the Washington, D.C.-based U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), construction companies employ various processes that will enable them to achieve this goal.\n\nThese processes may include MMC – modern methods of construction, renewable energy on job sites and controlling waste of materials from construction sites. With an increasing amount of attention on the environmental impact of every industry, more construction projects require sustainable construction practices. \n\nThe use of construction cameras in sustainable practices \n\nConstruction cameras are an emerging technology being used by many construction companies to achieve sustainable construction practices on their sites. The automated capture and processing of data from construction cameras ensures operational sustainability.\n\nPlanning capabilities delivered by reality capture make it possible for operations to understand the impact of construction on the surrounding environment, and a plan for proper waste management. Proper drainage facilities are put in place so that concrete wash doesn’t settle or contaminate the water in the environment. \n\nEvercam features: How our customers are using Evercam for sustainability\nManage traffic & throughput \n\nArtificial intelligence used by construction cameras, such as Evercam’s Gate Report feature ensures that the time difference between entry and exit of the vehicles to site is monitored and carbon print is properly regulated.\n\nA contractor is able to control how many vehicles leave the source of material to site at a particular time. Accessing a live view of a construction site can enable construction teams to view progress from anywhere which in turn will reduce commute emissions, fuel consumption, road congestion, and noise pollution. \n\nBIM Integration with cameras \n\nUsing building information modelling (BIM) data generated during design and build over the whole project lifecycle enables faster, safer, less wasteful construction and more cost-effective, sustainable operation, maintenance, and eventual decommissioning.\n\nCo-ordinated BIM input provided by all project partners aids sustainability in many ways at three key stages: the design, construction, and maintenance phases:\n\n1. The design phase:\n\nBIM fosters a more transparent process at the design phase. The transparency afforded here allows for contractors, energy engineers, suppliers, and more to advise on the structure’s overall construction and operation of the building early on, providing greater sustainability at the design phase before spending anything.\n\nThis means that only environmentally-responsible materials and methods are used, as well as saving time and money on reworking and rescheduling.\n\nDesign changes made while the project definition is still flexible can be accommodated without cost and time penalties.\nCoordination of design contributes to accurate ordering of materials and equipment, eliminating waste and rework.\nDigital design and visualisation also make it easier to compare alternative options, allowing environmental and visual impacts to be assessed and providing opportunities to discuss the concerns of the public and special interest groups and identify the best solution.\n2. Construction phases: (operations)\n\nThe 3D models provided by BIM allow users to verify that the project is on-time by comparing real-time footage to the BIM model or fast forward to see where the project should be in two weeks, allowing for workflows to be reviewed and enhanced at every stage.\n\nUsing BIM in this phase has several knock-on effects on sustainability:  it saves time, improves efficiency, enhances the design, reduces and avoids errors.\nAlso using BIM can allow identifying the common components that you could fabricate offsite,  which eliminates over-ordering, reduces waste, and allows offcut materials to be reused or recycled. Visualisation and construction sequencing functions within BIM can also improve environmentally conscious construction practices.\nCo-ordinated BIM input provided by all project partners aids sustainability in ways such as offsite fabrication of common components, which eliminates over-ordering, reduces waste and allows offcut materials to be reused or recycled.\nBIM allows full, detailed component information to be embedded in the asset model. This can then be used to plan maintenance activities for assets with different design lives so that major repair and replacement programmes can be synchronised, minimising cost and disruption. It can also be used to record risks and set trigger levels for action. \n3. Maintenance phase: (After a project has been completed)\n\nBIM allows full, detailed component information to be embedded in the asset model. This can then be used to plan maintenance activities for assets so that major repair and replacement programs can be synchronised, minimising cost and disruption. \n\nHow Evercam features are used \n\nEvercam offers solar powered cameras,ensuring the use of renewable energy when required. The use of such cameras helps to reduce the on-site carbon footprint since there is no need for cable connection or use of generators. \n\nHaving a 24/7 live view of your job site keeps you connected to your project from anywhere. Having a reliable distance monitoring tool, reduces frequent personnel site visits, allowing to reduce commute emissions, fuel consumption, road congestion, and noise pollution. \n\nStakeholders are able to receive scheduled updates regularly and follow the key events of the project and particular milestones as and when needed.\n\nUsing the Snapmail feature to receive emails with a snapshot from the camera directly to the users inbox results in reduced number of site visits, thereby helping construction companies to comply with city regulations of  sustainable mobility, reduced road congestion and the transition to reduced carbon emissions.\n\nWith Evercam construction camera software, everything that happens on your construction site is recorded during the entire duration of a project, in high resolution, and stored in the cloud. Users can go back at any point in time and remotely verify events that occurred on site. \n\nThat can be used to; reduce energy consumption e.g ensuring that lights are off after working hours and also help in monitoring compliance with construction waste management plans.\n\nConstruction cameras are becoming more and more useful in sustainable construction as they document best practices in projects for future reference. Construction companies are using time-lapse footage to market green projects and showcase their commitment to sustainability. \n\nTo find out more about our software, get in touch with us today. \n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nBook a demo\nContact\n\n6-7 Granby Row, Dublin 1, Ireland\n+353 1 919 4500\n\n\n\nOther Locations\nIE\nUK\nSG\nAU\nUS\nPL\nConstruction Cameras\nCamera Specs\nProjects\nPricing\nTutorials\nBlog\nResources\nE-books\nCase Studies\nReality Capture\nSitemap\nProductivity\nSoftware Integrations\nProject Management\nMarketing\nA.I. for Construction\nAbout\nTerms & Conditions\nGDPR compliance\nTrust Center\nAbout\nContact Us\nCareers\nTestimonials\nPartners\nBecome An Installer\nFind An Installer\nFeatures\nTime-lapse\nLive View\nRecordings\nGate Report\nX-Ray\nBIM Integration\nDrones in Construction\nProgress Photos\nZoom\nCompare Tool\nMark-up Tool\nGoogle Play\n \nApple Store\n\n \nWhatsApp\n \nGithub\n \nLinkedin\n \nTwitter\n \nFacebook\n \nVimeo\n \nYoutube\n \nInstagram"

For this 12 month project, Evercam is partnering with ProperGate to automate delivery and logistics processes on-site with visual evidence.\n\nProperGate is a Polish company that offers a smart logistics collaboration platform that optimizes material delivery management, and on-site transport on complex construction projects. The company develops high-level workflows for scheduling and mapping the logistics on-site, linking tasks to assigned people – system users.\n\nEvercam is a leader in construction cameras, offering a comprehensive system that overlooks the entire site and extracts relevant details. We provide our construction customers with verification tools based on images and videos, improving their visibility of the site. We know that material delivery and its appropriate storage are complex, largely manual, and thus, error-prone processes. Limited visibility and inefficient planning can lead to misunderstandings, waste, costly delays, and disputes. With construction cameras installed on-site, project management is eased as stakeholders can track the progress, communicate effectively and collect valuable proof of events.\n\nWe look forward to spending the rest of this year on building experimental two-way integration between Evercam and ProperGate which will enable users to not only monitor site activities but also track material deliveries and control their storage. The proposed integration will enhance ProperGate’s smart logistics plans and delivery records with Evercam visual evidence. The developed workflows will optimize the repeatable operations on construction sites and provide the project stakeholders with true insights helping them default to best practices and make the right decisions at the right time.\n\nThis project will open up new avenues in automated logistics management on construction sites, contributing to the enhancement of this industry’s innovation capacity. Upon successful completion, the integrated system will support its users – logistics personnel, planners, schedulers, site management, in monitoring material deliveries and managing storage on construction sites, increasing the overall transparency and accountability, providing tangible benefits in productivity and sustainability for the construction sector. \n\nAmong the construction stakeholders that will benefit from this project are logistics planners and managers on site. With a centralized system for smart site management, planners will be able to schedule deliveries in line with realistic site needs, booking trucks for the exact and correct day and time. These controlled deliveries will hereby help construction companies to comply with city regulations of sustainable mobility, reducing road congestion and carbon emissions. Optimized logistics processes, supported with visual evidence and computer vision automation, will help to identify costs that fall outside of the project scope. According to ScienceDirect, as much as 30% of all building materials delivered to a typical construction site end up being wasted, often due to damage, loss, or over-ordering. This integrated system will help reduce these statistics thanks to proper planning and documentation. \n\nEvercam’s construction camera systems will improve project visibility and team communication, decrease dependence on personnel on-site, reduce the bottlenecks at the entry gate, ensuring prompt delivery collection on-site thereby increasing construction productivity \n\nAt Evercam, the number one priority is to build useful products that bring value to our customers.  Our software began with a foundation focused on construction time-lapse and has since then evolved into an integral tool for our customers. We have developed every feature by asking our customers the question “What problem can we help you solve?”. \n\nThis latest advancement in our software improves project visibility and team communication, decreases dependence on personnel on-site, reduces the bottlenecks at the entry gate, ensures prompt delivery collection on-site thereby increasing construction productivity.\n\nMore posts on this topic coming up as the work progresses over the coming months!\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Initially, she started in law but soon discovered her true calling in sales, especially within the construction industry, thanks to her interest in architecture and photography. Now, at nearly 30, Scarlett has created a unique career path that showcases her passion and adaptability. In this month’s Voices of Evercam Q&A, she shares her career highlights, insights into the latest construction technology, and the lessons she has learned.\n\nCan you tell us a bit about your background?\n\nSure! I’ve been working in sales for about 12 years now. Initially, I studied law, but  I quickly realized that I’m a bit of a chatterbox and love engaging with people, which naturally led me to a career in sales. I’ve always been outgoing and active, enjoying hobbies like playing games and going to the gym. I started in recruitment, then moved into tech sales, and eventually found my way into the construction industry. \n\nWhat inspired you to transition from law to construction sales?\n\nMy journey into the construction industry began unexpectedly with a sales job in recruitment. A client headhunted me for a role in a company specializing in time-lapse photography for construction projects. I found the industry fascinating, especially due to my interest in architecture and photography. As a child, I loved building houses in The Sims, which likely sparked my early interest in construction.\n\nWhat drew you specifically to the technology side of construction?\n\nInitially, it was the sales aspect that attracted me – I believe that if you’re passionate, you can sell any product. However, once I joined Evercam, the technology and AI side of construction tech really captivated me. The vision for AI and machine learning to analyze years of video data from construction sites is incredibly inspiring. I’m passionate about the future of our AI products.\n\nHow do you stay ahead of technological advancements in the construction industry?\n\nA big part of it is getting out there and talking to people on the ground in different roles – project managers, contractors, surveyors, and so on. I ask lots of open questions to understand their pain points and workflows. You get such valuable insights this way that you can’t always get from researching online. The other part is being fully immersed in our product roadmaps and future AI capabilities so I can evangelize that vision.\n\nHave you had any particularly challenging or rewarding projects or sales?\n\nOne of the most challenging roles was in recruitment, especially dealing with candidates. Everyone had different job requirements, which made it difficult to match them with the right roles. I discovered that I preferred the client side of recruitment which led to my interest in selling products & software.\n\nIn my sales career, one of my most rewarding achievements was at my previous company. In my first year, I billed nearly £1 million at age 26, which was double what my predecessor achieved. This success allowed the company to invest more in R&D and take the product further, which was rewarding.\n\nWhat advice would you give to companies considering construction cameras?\n\nI advise companies to look beyond traditional security cameras. Evercam’s solutions offer much more than surveillance.\n\nwe provide high-quality video footage of entire projects, which is essential for project management, dispute resolution, and future planning. Our AI capabilities add even more value by delivering insights and efficiencies that standard cameras can’t. People often think it’s just a niche product, but there’s so much more to it. Considering the long-term benefits and ROI, Evercam’s solutions are a smart investment for any construction project.\n\nHow do you build and maintain long-term relationships with clients?\n\nIt’s about being genuine and interested in the person, not just business, which is key. I enjoy the challenge of connecting with initially “difficult” people who might be busy or having a bad day. Building a long-term relationship means going beyond small talk to find common interests, like football or family.\n\nWhen meeting anyone new, I try to have a meaningful conversation and be genuinely interested in them as a person. That’s how you build trust and strong relationships over time.\n\nHow do you manage expectations and handle challenges with clients?\n\nManaging expectations is all about clear communication and understanding the client’s needs and pain points. I ask open questions to understand their challenges and then tailor our solutions to address those issues. Building a rapport and finding common ground also helps. If challenges arise, I stay transparent and work collaboratively with the client to find a resolution. It’s about being proactive and showing that you care about their success.\n\nHow have mentors helped shape your professional perspective?\n\nMentors have kept me motivated, thinking outside the box and gaining different perspectives. I’m quite fortunate to have had some great mentors. One significant mentor was a lady from KPMG who headhunted me. She provided strategic advice and helped shape my career early on. Currently, I have regular sessions with Adam, our global learning coach. We have an hour-long weekly session every week where he provides useful insights into how I should conduct meetings, structure my sales process, pitch to clients, and more. Having that experienced sounding board is something I truly value.\n\nWhat’s one thing you can’t go without in your workday?\n\nPeople! I’m a people person. Interacting with others and building relationships is crucial, whether it’s clients, colleagues, or mentors. I can’t be productive without that human element.\n\nOutside of work, what are you passionate about?\n\nFitness is a big part of my life. My favorite sport is skiing during the winter months with friends or family. \n\nI also love traveling. Last year, I spent two months in Africa, visiting nine countries, including Madagascar, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. It was incredible experiencing all the different cultures and natural beauty, especially in Madagascar. Asia is next on my list and down under as my family and friends live that way. \n\nHow has your experience as a personal trainer influenced your career?\n\nHelping others improve their wellness was incredibly rewarding. I started training at 16 and officially qualified by 18. I was helping such a diverse range of clients improve their physical and mental well-being. From training teenagers with disabilities to young adults around my age, to older and more frail clients in their 60s and 70s who wanted to get active – I got to build relationships with all kinds of people.\n\nOne client who stands out to me was a young boy with Down’s syndrome. Despite his disability, he was incredibly strong and determined. Seeing his positive changes, like walking in with a big smile after making progress towards his goals, was very fulfilling. Seeing someone happy because of something I have helped them with gives me a sense of achievement and this has transpired from my time as a personal trainer into my career in sales.\n\nAre there any skills from the fitness industry that you’ve transferred to your current career?\n\nDiscipline and routine are the main skills. It’s helped me stay productive, especially when working from home, and keep a consistent approach to my work. The people skills I developed, like active listening, empathy, and motivating others. And that feeling of helping someone achieve their vision, whether fitness or business, is deeply satisfying. So those years as a trainer laid a strong foundation for my approach to client relationships now.\n\nYou’ve been involved in various campaigns like “Late Night Do it Right,”, “The Anti-Abuse Campaign,”, and “Find a Flatmate.” Which of these causes resonates most deeply with you on a personal level, and why?\n\nThe “Late Night Do it Right” campaign resonates most deeply with me. As the VP of Community and Welfare in 2014, I spearheaded this initiative to reduce student casualties in A&E during Freshers Week. Recognizing the challenges new students faced in navigating campus, especially at night, we focused on educating them about safe behavior while enjoying their social lives. The campaign promoted responsible alcohol consumption, zero tolerance for sexual harassment, and protection against drink spiking. We provided practical support, such as branded flip-flops for those in high heels and tin foil jackets for those feeling cold. Despite being some time ago, this campaign had a lasting impact, making nights out safer and more enjoyable for students.\n\nLooking forward, what are your future goals and ambitions?\n\nI see myself at Evercam for the long term, possibly even for the rest of my career. I believe Evercam is a fantastic company to work for, as they are ambitious, forward-thinking, and take care of their employees. I’m deeply passionate about the company, our AI product roadmap, and especially the people I work with, including my clients. In terms of personal goals, I aim to excel in my sales career, own my own home one day, and obtain my motorbike license for more adventures. I also have a strong desire to travel, with Asia and Australia next on my list. However, I consider myself a free spirit and am always happy to go where the wind blows.\n\nConnect With Scarlett\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nFaith Tangara\n\nConstruction Writer\nDate : 24-07-2024 Last Modified Date : 16-08-2024\n   \nVoices of Evercam: Meet Shannon Brown – Head of Customer Success\n“Success means taking full ownership of every project, guiding it from start to finish, while keeping the customer at the heart of everything we do. Be a driver, not a passenger.”\n\nShannon’s journey in sales is marked by a unique blend of passion, adaptability, and a knack for innovation. From her early days in telecoms to becoming a pivotal female figure in the construction technology industry, her career path reveals a deep commitment to driving results and embracing new challenges. This month’s Voices of Evercam offers an inside look at Shannon’s career highlights, her approach to client success, and her vision for the future of construction technology.\n\nPlease share a bit about your background and how you ended up in construction technology.\n\nAbsolutely! My career began in a rather unexpected way. During college, I was waitressing one summer and impressed a customer with my multitasking skills. It turned out he was the CEO of Hill International, a top construction management firm, and he offered me an internship. This early exposure to the construction industry was eye-opening. After that, I interned at Greenhouse Software, which gave me insights into the startup world and the importance of a well-run sales development program. After graduation, I started at AT&T, where I honed my sales skills, and then moved to Intellisite, where I first encountered video analytics. This experience set the stage for my current role at Evercam, where I’ve been able to merge my interests in technology and construction.\n\nWhat strategies do you use to ensure client success at Evercam?\n\nThe most important piece of the puzzle is understanding what our clients are trying to get out of Evercam and aligning expectations. We need to make sure we’re providing them with the right solutions. Once we get that right, the next steps are adoption and enabling them to get the most out of their investment in line with their goals. This involves training and working with their internal project administrators to align Evercam with their project and business needs.\n\nIt’s all about education. We understand and listen to their goals, set expectations, and educate them. If we get those three things right, value will be realized, and they will become our friends for life and want to stay with Evercam. It’s a partnership, and every employee and department in the company plays a role in making our customers successful.\n\nHow do you see AI and data analytics shaping the future of the construction industry?\n\nIt’s incredibly exciting to think about where AI and analytics can take construction intelligence. Evercam has been capturing billions of images on job sites for over a decade now. And those images have already saved clients tons of time and money – resolving disputes, catching mistakes early, and sharing best practices across projects.\n\nBut we’re really just scratching the surface of the value trapped in all that visual data. With AI, we’ll be able to turn images and video into words, numbers, trends – automatically quantifying productivity, safety, quality. Imagine being able to instantly analyze progress across all your projects, pinpoint delays, see what’s working and what’s not.\n\nAnd not just looking backwards, but using AI to predict issues before they happen and course-correct in real-time. We’ll unlock insights that save lives, not just dollars. The future is being able to see the full timeline of your project – past, present and future – and make data-driven decisions to optimise every aspect.\n\nWe’re already seeing €30,000 in average savings per project. But that’s going to be multiplied as we apply AI across the treasure trove of reality capture data we have. It’s an exciting time to be in construction tech. We’re going to see a step-change in what’s possible.\n\nCan you share a specific success story or impact of your work at Evercam?\n\nOne of our clients, UPS, has been a massive part of our hardware roadmap and improving our hardware product for self-installation. We started working with them on a few projects, and now we’re their preferred and exclusive reality capture provider in the US.\n\nKevin Wooldridge, one of the core adopters team at UPS was initially skeptical about Evercam. Now, he’s a complete convert. He says that Evercam has saved him over 30 hours of windshield time and well over $50,000 in rework on his last project. It’s not always the big things that make the most impact; it’s the small moments where you make someone’s day a little bit easier that bring the most satisfaction and joy to the job. \n\nWhat are some of the common challenges faced by the construction industry, and how does Evercam help address them?\n\nOne of the major challenges in the construction industry is interoperability – the ability for all the data to flow together across different phases of construction. There are various technology tools and silos, and they don’t connect well.\n\nEvercam is working towards bringing that all together in a full circle, capturing data so that customers can visualize, analyze, and learn from it for future projects. Evercam provides an open API that makes it easy for customers to ingest their data and push it out to their custom applications.\n\nAnother one is safety and risk management. There’s difficulty in ensuring safety compliance, proactively identifying risks, validating insurance claims, and accurately predicting safety risks. Evercam is helping customers by providing trainings specifically for safety, aligning with their safety manuals, and building out additional value through our AI capabilities to make identifying risks and learning from incidents easier.\n\nYou’ve had a remarkable career trajectory. Can you tell us about a pivotal moment that defined your current role?\n\nWhen I started 3.5 years ago, it was just me and another early US hire trying to establish Evercam’s presence in the US from scratch. We had to be scrappy – no marketing budget, just manually emailing and calling prospects. But we discovered there was real product-market fit.\n\nI loved the prospecting side, identifying those pre-buying signals you just don’t see in other industries. I excelled at getting our foot in the door. But very quickly, we saw a gap between marketing and sales in how leads were handled. Every region did it differently. So, I took the lead in standardizing our lead management processes and building out a BDR team to bridge that gap. We made our first hire in APAC, and just figured it out as we went.\n\nThe goal has always been to replicate myself – to build a system and a team that doesn’t rely on any single individual to survive. The BDR is now under Yuri’s leadership. She stepped into my shoes and then some. That’s when the need for customer success became truly apparent. We realized the first sale is just the beginning of the project lifecycle. I transitioned to heading up Customer Success, partnering with Eoin who had built an incredible team from the ground up. We’ve realized over the last 12 months ensuring our customers are successful is the key to unlocking value, building champions, and big picture long term revenue growth – which is why we are investing significantly in building a more customer-centric culture and bringing the CS team to the next level of maturity.\t\t\nHow do you ensure that Evercam remains customer-centric and continuously adapts to client needs?\n\nTrue customer-centricity at Evercam starts with deep understanding. We put the customer at the center of everything we do, listening, educating, and iterating to truly grasp their project and organizational objectives. From the initial sales interaction, we uncover their reality capture goals and define success before a project begins. We then educate customers on how to maximize the platform throughout each milestone, ensuring they understand their specific project goals, pain points, and measures of success. Setting clear expectations upfront is crucial. We ensure our entire team is aligned with the client’s vision, fostering a shared sense of purpose. A committed site contact is key to successful projects, and gaining buy-in from the client is essential. We want every interaction, from sales to onboarding to ongoing support, to reinforce that we “get” them and are laser-focused on driving the outcomes they care about.\n\n\t\n\nBeyond technology, we invest heavily in change management and adoption. Tailored training, collaboration with client administrators, and ongoing support empower them to fully embrace Evercam and realize its value.  We try to impart that client-centric mindset across our whole team.\n\nAt the end of the day, if the client isn’t vocally thrilled with the impact we’ve had on their business, we haven’t succeeded. So we’re relentless about chasing down those “a-ha moments” where the value of Evercam clicks for the very first time, and many more following!\n\nWhat are some of the most common client feedback or requests that have led to new features or improvements at Evercam?\n\nClient feedback has been key in shaping Evercam’s product development. For instance, we received feedback from UPS and other clients about the need for more self-installable hardware and better integration capabilities. This led to improvements into our hardware product and installation process, and led to the creation of Evercam’s user manual. Cody Whitelock at Barnhill started as a customer, and has evolved into a close friend consultant and podcast host for evercam following his series of useful product feedback, including the weather functionality and drone view volumetrics. Enhancements in these areas have been directly influenced by the needs and requests of our clients, demonstrating our commitment to continuous improvement based on user feedback.\n\nYou mentioned the importance of leaning on and supporting other women in the construction industry. Can you elaborate on that and share your thoughts on the challenges and opportunities for women in this field?\n\nBeing a woman in construction presents both challenges and opportunities. The industry needs our unique perspectives and ways of thinking. While it’s still a male-dominated field, other women are paving the way and serving as trailblazers, like Nancy Novak at Compass Datacenters. It’s important for women to lean on and support each other to help us all succeed.\n\nAs a rising female leader, I’m learning to balance the collaboration and empathy typically expected of women with the assertiveness and efficiency needed for strong leadership. Part of my journey is highlighting these double standards when I see them with my colleagues, while also leveraging my unique strengths as a woman to lead effectively.\n\n\t\n\nThere are definitely challenges, but I believe the opportunities are greater if you seize them and run with them. Evercam and our founders, Marco, Randall and Vinnie, are committed to supporting and propelling women and folks from different regions and backgrounds. My career has skyrocketed at Evercam over the last 3.5 years, and I’m beyond grateful for the amount I’ve been able to learn and grow here in such a short amount of time. I am wholeheartedly committed to paying it forward by empowering and advancing other women within our company. I’m proud to be part of a culture that provides opportunities for all of us and taking continuous steps towards creating an even more inclusive environment.\n\nHow do you balance your career and personal life, especially considering your rapid growth and leadership role at Evercam?\n\nBalancing career and personal life is something I’m still learning to do. I’ve realized that to be productive in your job, you need to have that balance. In the past, I would work long hours because I enjoyed it, but I’ve come to understand that neglecting other aspects of life, like taking care of yourself and spending time with family, can lead to burnout.\n\nI’ve made a commitment to myself to disconnect on weekends, sometimes even deleting work-related apps from my phone. I believe that this balance not only makes me a happier person but also a better colleague and a more productive employee. It’s an ongoing learning process that I’m embracing.\n\nImagine it’s the year 2030. What headline would you like to read about Evercam or construction technology?\n\nI would like to read, “Evercam Saves Lives.” I genuinely believe that we have the power to not just bring efficiencies, productivity, and collaboration to the workforce but to make construction sites safer places to work. It’s an impactful mission to be a part of.\n\nConnect With Shannon\n\nShannon Keeler Brown\n\nHead of Customer Success\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

From reducing operational costs to improving financial performance, technology enables companies to deliver projects more efficiently, increase profitability, and maintain a competitive edge. \n\nA well-executed technology implementation plan can transform how projects are managed, ensuring teams have the right tools at every phase, from pre-construction to final handover. But what does this process look like in practice? How can technology be seamlessly integrated into complex workflows? These were some of the questions unpacked in our first webinar.\n\nThis webinar session featured an exciting discussion between Eoin O’Neill, our Head of Customer Success Team, and Cody Whitelock, Director of Innovation and Professional Development at Barnhill Contracting Company. Cody shared his experience integrating Evercam into Barnhill’s construction projects and provided practical insights into making technology work on the ground.\n\nWhat is a Technology Implementation Plan?\n\nCody explained how Barnhill set up a technology plan. It starts early, even before breaking ground, and continues through pre-construction and operations. The process ensures the right tools are in place to meet the project’s needs. As Cody put it, “We approach technology mobilization much like we do our projects—starting from the pursuit phase, through pre-construction, and into operations. This ensures the right tools are in place to meet each project’s unique needs.”\n\nReality Capture Transforming Construction\n\nReality capture is becoming a key part of construction. Tools like laser scanning, drones, 360 cameras, and construction cameras play a big role in tracking progress. Cody highlighted how Evercam has redefined construction cameras, turning them from simple time-lapse solutions into tools that improve scheduling, inspections, and project transparency. Platforms like ours offer dynamic construction site camera solutions, making them essential for modern workflows.\n\nOvercoming Technology Adoption Challenges \n\nImplementing technology in construction has always been challenging. Therefore, transparency has been key to overcoming resistance from subcontractors and clients. Evercam’s clear visuals of planned versus actual progress help teams align expectations and address delays effectively. By encouraging collaboration and maintaining open communication, the process ensures mutual success for all parties involved. Tools like time-lapse construction cameras play a critical role in providing the clarity needed for these discussions.\n\nLeveraging Site Weather Data\n\nOne standout feature is Evercam’s use of weather data. On-site weather stations linked to construction cameras provide reliable data for weather delay claims. This has improved reporting and helped planning and scheduling. Cody emphasized how valuable this feature has been in dealing with unpredictable conditions. Having a jobsite camera that integrates weather insights has become vital to managing these challenges.\n\n4D BIM Integration\n\nOur BIM Compare feature provides a practical way to track progress in real time. By overlaying BIM models onto live construction cameras, teams can quickly identify discrepancies and adjust them to stay on schedule. Using live view and time-lapse cameras for construction helps bridge the gap between planning and execution, ensuring better outcomes.\n\nOur Technology, Their Success\n\nCody shared how we supported key project milestones like groundbreaking, topping out, and completion. Our platform has also been useful for addressing safety concerns, weather impacts, and scheduling disputes. These success stories show how time-lapse construction video solutions add value and transparency at every project stage.\n\nLooking Ahead: Barnhill and Evercam\n\nThe webinar wrapped up with a look at the future. Cody noted that Evercam is now a standard tool for many Barnhill projects, including medium-sized ones. As we continue to evolve with new features, it’s clear that our platform will remain an essential part of modern construction workflows.

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nFaith Tangara\n\nConstruction Writer\nDate : 23-12-2022 Last Modified Date : 14-06-2024\n   \nHow Reality Capture Cameras Are Changing Data Centre Construction\n\nData centre projects are large-scale undertakings that require significant financing investments. These projects involve the construction of specialized facilities that are designed to support the storage, processing, and distribution of large amounts of data. Data centres typically consist of a network of servers, storage systems, and other infrastructure that are housed in secure, climate-controlled environments.\n\nBuilding a data centre requires significant capital investments to purchase and install the necessary hardware, as well as to develop and maintain the infrastructure needed to support it. Additionally, data centres often require ongoing investment to keep up with the ever-evolving demands of the technology industry. \n\nIn 2020, the global market for data centre construction was estimated to be worth £15 billion and is projected to reach £24 billion by 2027. The data centre industry is also anticipated to expand annually until 2024 despite a 10.3% decrease in data centre spending in 2020 as a result of the pandemic’s reduced financial flow. \n\nWith this level of financing, construction cameras become a valuable asset for data centre construction projects, helping teams to ensure that projects are completed on schedule and within budget. AI construction cameras are a powerful tool for project teams, as they allow teams to monitor multiple construction projects at the same time.\n\nThese cameras are equipped with AI technology that allows them to automatically capture and analyze images of the construction site, providing valuable insights and real-time updates to project teams and investors. \n\nTime performance is one of the most crucial factors when working on a construction project. Data centre projects cannot bear the risk of losing money through any form of delay. Being high-value projects, construction cameras can help to reduce the risk of delays and financial losses by providing real-time footage of the construction site, construction cameras can help project managers identify potential problems early on and take corrective action to prevent the project from falling behind schedule.\n\nFor example, if the cameras detect that a piece of equipment is not being used efficiently, the project manager can take steps to address the issue before it causes significant delays. \n\nLiquidated damages are a common feature of construction contracts, including those for data centre projects. These are predetermined damages that a contractor agrees to pay to the owner if the contractor fails to complete the project on time or within budget. The amount of liquidated damages is typically specified in the contract and is based on estimates of the potential losses that the owner may incur as a result of the contractor’s delay.\n\nReal-time site monitoring can help to reduce the risk of liquidated damages by providing real-time footage of the construction site. This helps project stakeholders to make decisions based on the progress to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget, reducing the likelihood of incurring liquidated damages.\n\nConstruction cameras provide data that can be used in the future. The images and footage captured by the cameras can provide valuable insights into the construction process, which can be used to identify best practices and improve the efficiency of future projects.\n\nFor example, if the cameras reveal that a particular method or technique is particularly effective, this information can be used to inform the design and planning of future data centre projects. The data captured by construction cameras can also be used for legal purposes, such as resolving disputes or defending against legal challenges. Overall, construction cameras provide a wealth of data that can be used for future reference in a variety of ways.\n\nSite monitoring has over time become a vital part of any construction project that has the common goal to ensure that construction projects are completed within the constraints of the best quality, stipulated timeframe, and with the minimum cost possible.\n\nThis represents a substantial investment for developers, especially because the cost of construction can easily escalate if the construction project is not properly monitored. Anything that can cut construction costs, shorten delivery time, and provide quality outputs benefits both developers and contractors, which is why more commercial projects are deploying construction cameras.\n\nThe data centre industry has garnered increased attention as we begin to understand how our digital world is supported by this unseen physical infrastructure. With this attention, also come questions about faster construction of these facilities as well as achieving the highest quality of standard that is required of them. This is why construction cameras become a much-desired necessity when it comes to the construction of data centre facilities.\n\nHong Kong Data Centre. Courtesy: Colliers\nCommon risks for data centres:\nExpensive material, deliveries & tracking\n\nTurner & Townsend’s Data Centre Cost Index 2022 analysed construction input costs across 45 key markets and found that the cost of building data centres has soared around the world as contractors battle with materials and skills shortages. It goes without saying that due to the expensive materials required to set up a data centre, such as copper cables; storage systems; servers; network infrastructure, such as switches and routers; and various information security elements, such as firewalls, it is important to have live-view site monitoring to ensure that the site is protected against theft of materials and wastage. \n\nHaving a log of the vehicles that enter the site is important for any project. Evercam has developed a solution to aid the way vehicle data is captured on-site. With manual logging of vehicles entering and exiting a project site being difficult, activating Evercam’s Gate Report feature using a dedicated fixed position camera on a site gives the user more data and control of vehicle movement, just on-time deliveries, traffic control, and throughput. The report includes an accurate delivery log with time-stamped images as well as links for footage from Evercam cameras that can detect over 10 different types of vehicle types. \n\nConstruction defects – we record every moment of the construction process and store them for 3 years\n\nAs part of data centre design, consideration must be put on equipment interoperability and compatibility. For quality control purposes, it is necessary to set up cameras that capture every step of construction to ensure that all design factors are adequately considered. Evercam can not only provide a tool for site monitoring but also long-term secure storage of high-quality video footage for up to 3 years after the project is complete.\n\nShould there be a need for an upgrade or extension to the development, questions such as “how will the upgrade affect the rest of the data centre infrastructure? What about extensibility? Can you expand the existing systems without compatibility problems?” can be easily answered by referring to the footage. \n\nProject documentation: \n\nThe objective of data centre design is to maximize uptime while minimizing power consumption. Its construction from start to finish should therefore be monitored to ensure the proper installation of systems that will enable the achievement of this objective.\n\nWith progress monitoring, project teams can communicate key milestones and make informed decisions that will enable them to finish the project on schedule. Integrating an Evercam camera with BIM allows the project team to compare the real-time footage to the model to track the quality and precision of the project.\n\nThe BIM model is used for generating a graphic that is used during the constructability review. It demonstrates to investors and project stakeholders that the methodology is executed as described initially. At the end of a project, it is common for a full recording of the entire project to be provided.\n\nThis recording, often in the form of a video, typically includes an as-built Building Information Model (BIM) which can be used for reference and documentation. The BIM model provides a detailed representation of the completed project, including all of its various components and systems. It can be used to verify that the final project matches the original design specifications, and can also serve as a valuable reference for future maintenance or renovations.\n\n Use images and video to communicate key milestones throughout the project\n\nConstruction projects often require the coordination of multiple teams over large amounts of time, making it difficult to stay up to date on project progress. Using construction cameras helps project coordinators stay on top of key milestones, like structural constructions, concrete pours, façade installations, and more!\n\nBy having remote access to the camera’s images and videos, teams can easily collaborate with one another to ensure nothing is overlooked or left behind. Construction cameras enable teams to take a proactive approach when it comes to executing complicated builds, saving time, and ensuring maximum efficiency.\n\nSupport precision in the construction process\n\nData centre projects require the utmost capacity planning and precision when it comes to executing their construction. This is where recording every moment of the construction in the full video is essential.\n\nEvercam is the only construction camera provider that captures every detail of a project with up to 18X beyond the basic zoom level in video. This ensures certain critical aspects of data centre construction such as network cabling, and thermal management is adequately managed and reviewed as the project progresses.\n\nConstruction companies are always looking for ways to improve the accuracy of their data and save time and money on-site. With the advent of new reality capture technologies, construction firms now have access to highly accurate 3D models that can be used for pre-construction planning, clash detection, as-built documentation, and more.\n\nThe benefits of using reality capture cameras in construction are clear, and the technology is only going to become more popular in the coming years.

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nFaith Tangara\n\nConstruction Writer\nDate : 30-01-2023 Last Modified Date : 28-04-2023\n   \n10 Ways How Construction Cameras Can Reduce Risk & Protect Margins\n\nConstruction cameras are an increasingly popular tool for construction managers looking to improve safety. By providing real-time documentation and monitoring of projects, construction cameras can help avoid costly delays, manage projects remotely, and improve overall efficiency. They create a visual record of progress on a construction site, which can be used for documentation purposes. This record can be helpful in the event of an insurance claim or dispute. \n\nHere are 10 ways that construction cameras can help to reduce risk and protect margins on construction projects:\n\n1. Provide Evidence of Delays\n\nConstruction delays negatively impact a project’s outcome, leading to additional costs and reduced profits. There are several factors that can cause delays in construction projects, including inadequate planning, lack of communication between team members, inefficient material management, equipment failure, poor weather, project complexity, design variations, ineffective resource management and labour challenges, and implementation failure.\n\nTo minimize the risk of delays, it is important for project managers to effectively plan and manage the project, maintain good communication with all team members, properly manage materials and resources, and use advanced technology and tools. Construction cameras play a critical role in providing evidence for the cause of delays or otherwise minimizing delays altogether.\n\nBy reviewing the footage captured, project managers can identify the root cause of the delay and take appropriate action to resolve the issue and get the project back on track. In the event of a dispute or disagreement over the cause of a delay, the footage from the cameras can serve as evidence to support the project team’s position.\n\nConstruction cameras can also help prevent delays by enabling project managers to proactively monitor the construction site and identify potential issues before they become significant problems. By regularly reviewing the footage, project managers can identify potential bottlenecks and address them before they become costly for the project. \n\n2. Objective Progress Reporting\n\nBy offering an interactive real-time view of project progress, construction cameras bridge the gap between the planning stages and execution stages, allowing management to have a better understanding of what jobs need to be done and whether those tasks are being completed properly and on time.\n\nThey also offer a secure platform for teams to collaborate with one another, which allows for more efficient progress tracking in order to efficiently deliver high-calibre results. Evercam generates a 4D timeline which is a powerful tool to track the progress of construction sites, using the 3D model and project schedule information provided by the customer.\n\nThis 4D timeline also includes a BIM view calendar which highlights important milestones, and shows the next milestone coming up.\n\n3. Remote Monitoring\n\nSome construction cameras enable remote site monitoring, allowing project managers and other stakeholders to view live footage of the construction site from any location. This can be useful for project managers who need to monitor multiple projects simultaneously, or those who cannot be on-site due to travel or other constraints.\n\nPhysical site visits can be expensive and time-consuming, especially for project managers who need to monitor multiple projects simultaneously. By using construction cameras, project managers can view live footage of the construction site without travelling to a job site in person. This can save money on travel costs and reduce the time project managers need to spend on-site.\n\n4. Health and Safety Adherence\n\nHealth and safety are critical concerns in the construction industry, as construction work can be inherently dangerous. Construction cameras can help project managers to monitor the construction site for potential safety hazards, such as workers not wearing personal protective equipment or working in unsafe conditions. This can help to prevent accidents and injuries, which can have a negative impact on the project’s budget and schedule.\n\nAdditionally, construction cameras can provide valuable evidence in a safety incident. If an accident or injury occurs on the construction site, construction cameras can provide a record of what happened, which can be useful for investigating the incident and identifying the cause. This can help to prevent future incidents and improve the overall safety of the project.\n\nUnlike other providers, Evercam records every moment of the construction progress in full video, making it easier to identify root causes of accidents and near misses.\n\n5. Avoid Delays \n\nEvercam’s construction camera software is designed to capture every second of activity on a construction site in 4K video, providing a detailed record of the work being done. This high-quality video footage can be used to identify and mitigate potential risks before they occur.\n\nBy reviewing the video, construction companies can identify any issues that may arise during the construction process and take steps to address them before they become a problem. For example, if the video shows that a worker is not following proper safety protocols, the company can take steps to correct and prevent accidents from occurring.\n\nSimilarly, if the video reveals that a particular task is taking longer than expected, the company can adjust its schedule or allocate additional resources to ensure that the project stays on track.\n\n6. Resolve Disputes\n\nDisputes are a common problem in construction projects, as different parties may have different interpretations of the contract or may not agree on the scope of work. This can lead to delays and other problems, which can impact productivity and drive up costs.\n\nConstruction cameras can provide valuable evidence in a dispute, as they provide a record of the construction process. For example, if a contractor claims that unforeseen circumstances delayed them, construction cameras can provide evidence of what actually happened on the site. This can help to resolve disputes quickly and efficiently, without the need for costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.\n\nAdditionally, cameras can be used to document any changes to the scope of work or contract terms, providing a clear record of any changes that are made. This can help to prevent disputes and protect margins by ensuring that everyone is working from the same set of plans and specifications.\n\n(weather feature can be used to validate weather delay claims)\n\n7. Identify Best Practices\n\nConstruction cameras can provide valuable insights into the construction process, allowing project managers to identify best practices and improve the efficiency of future projects. For example, Evercam cameras can detect and document water damage causes and effects on a job site. if the cameras reveal that a particular method or technique is particularly effective, this information can be used to inform the design and planning of future projects.\n\n8. Monitor Subcontractors\n\nConstruction cameras can be used to monitor subcontractors and other third-party work, ensuring that they are meeting their obligations and completing their work on time. This can help to prevent delays and protect margins by ensuring that everyone is working together effectively.\n\n9. Document Changes to the Scope of Work\n\nUtilizing cameras on construction sites offers a unique level of visibility into the progress of a project. They can help contractors document changes to the scope of work and provide a comprehensive record of the project timeline, allowing for quick follow-up with stakeholders.\n\nThis evidence is crucial in protecting contractors from margin-eroding disputes and mitigating risks around project management. Not only can construction cameras assist in avoiding unnecessary costs and reinforcing accountability, but they also provide stakeholders with real-time access to review events and activities that may not be immediately visible.\n\nThis can be especially beneficial for large-scale projects or ones that require ongoing adjustments.\n\n10. Protect Against Theft and Vandalism\n\nConstruction cameras can be used to monitor the construction site for theft or vandalism, which can help to reduce losses and protect your margin. By keeping an eye on the site at all times, construction cameras can help to prevent these issues and save you time and money that would otherwise go towards repairing or replacing stolen or damaged equipment. On the other hand, in case of theft cases that have already occurred, Evercam’s X-Ray tool allows you to easily pool up historical images and video.\n\nLeveraging Data to Improve Efficiency \n\nUtilizing construction cameras can be a valuable asset in the construction industry, especially when it comes to improving efficiency. Cameras placed on construction sites capture a comprehensive overview of what is happening and can detect potential issues that may arise during the project.\n\nThis information can be used to provide accurate and timely feedback for managers and stakeholders so they can adjust their project plan if needed. Additionally, this data can be used to benchmark progress and monitor resource usage against budget estimations, affording efficient operations and greater cost savings. By leveraging data collected through workers’ use of digital tools like construction cameras, the entire process can become more optimised, leading to better overall outcomes.\n\nCameras offer numerous benefits for contractors looking to reduce risk and protect margins on their construction projects. By understanding the various camera feature options available, and selecting the right ones for the job, contractors can ensure that they have the necessary visibility and documentation to protect themselves from margin-eroding disputes and mitigate risks around project management.\n\nIf you’re interested in exploring the use of construction cameras on your project, consider checking out Evercam construction cameras.

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nFaith Tangara\n\nConstruction Writer\nDate : 13-03-2023 Last Modified Date : 15-03-2023\n   \nReality Capture and the Power of Drones: An In-Depth Look\n\nReality capture is a rapidly growing field that is changing the way we view and interact with the physical world of construction. It refers to the process of digitizing the physical world into a 3D model, providing us with a virtual representation of reality.\n\nThis can be achieved through various technologies like laser scanning, photogrammetry, and Structure from Motion (SfM). The resulting digital models can be used for a variety of purposes, including architectural design, construction, engineering, and asset management.\n\nOne of the most significant advancements in reality capture technology has been the integration of drones. Drones equipped with cameras and other sensors can capture high-resolution images and data from previously inaccessible locations, providing users with an unprecedented level of detail and accuracy. In this blog, we will delve into the role of drones in reality capture and the many benefits they provide.\n\nAdvantages of Using Drones in Reality Capture\n1. Drones Provide Great View\n\nThe use of drones, in reality capture, provides additional views because they can reach locations that would otherwise be difficult or dangerous for humans to access, such as the top of a tall building or remote construction sites. This reduces the need for numerous site visits to the site and the need to have equipment hoisted for longer periods of time.\n\n2. Drones Capture Images From Multiple Angles\n\nDrones can capture images from multiple angles, providing a more comprehensive view of the subject. This results in a more accurate 3D model, with a greater level of detail. For example, a drone can capture images from various elevations and angles, giving us a complete view of a building’s facade, roof, and surrounding area.\n\n3. Drones Cover Large Areas\n\nDrones can also cover large areas in a relatively short amount of time. This makes them ideal for capturing data in large construction sites. Progress assessment can be done within a shorter time than normal, providing valuable information that can be used to make decisions about the next steps in the construction process.\n\nThis enables project teams to stay connected, and monitor progress, weather, deliveries and other crucial aspects. The use of drones streamlined construction projects and provided efficient and convenient ways for teams to monitor their work. This also leads to significant cost savings for construction projects, as well as an increase in productivity and accuracy.\n\nFor example, a large construction site that would have taken several days to survey using traditional methods can be completed in a fraction of the time using drones. \n\n4. Safety and Convenience\n\nUsing drones in reality capture also offers increased safety and convenience. Surveying and collecting data in dangerous or inaccessible locations can be risky and time-consuming. However, with drones, this process can be done quickly and safely, reducing the risk of injury to personnel.\n\nThe Future of Reality Capture and Drones\n\nThe integration of drones in reality capture technology has brought about numerous benefits for the construction, architecture, engineering, and asset management industries. The ability to reach inaccessible locations, cover large areas, and provide a comprehensive view of projects has made drones a valuable tool in the field. With the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the potential for even more accurate and detailed models is limitless.\n\nThe use of drones in reality capture is only becoming more widespread as the years go by. Companies that embrace this technology and incorporate it into their processes will find themselves at a significant advantage. They will be able to streamline their work, reduce costs, and deliver more accurate and comprehensive data.\n\nIn the future, we can expect to see even more advanced drones equipped with a wide range of sensors and technologies, providing us with even more detailed and accurate models.\n\nAs a software company, one of the most exciting aspects of our work is that we get to experiment with the latest technology that can contribute to transforming the AEC industry, such as the use of drones. Recently, our team had the opportunity to map a large logistics centre using drones for site monitoring and reality capture.\n\nWe provided a full-service of drone view with capabilities such as a detailed representation of the construction site and surrounding area. From there, our customers were able to assess the state of a construction site down to the finest details, crosscheck the current condition of the site versus the planning, easily switch between the 3D model and the live Evercam camera view and also perform a safer and quicker inspection \n\nWhile aerial imagery has been around for a while, it often falls short in the construction industry due to the limitations of static photos which can be outdated and don’t capture data like Google Earth. However, by combining advanced drone features we can capture a current, comprehensive look at a site and gather a large amount of data.\n\nThe technology itself is impressive, but the applications are even more so. From being able to use tools like Evercam’s Drone View to measure distances to creating annotations on models to highlight a piece of information such as restricted areas.\n\nThe use of technologies such as these is vastly benefiting the industry allowing users to streamline processes, deliver more accurate information, and provide a comprehensive view of projects.\n\nSo, if you’re looking to stay ahead of the curve and make the most of your construction projects, consider incorporating drones into your reality capture process. With their versatility, efficiency, and accuracy, drones are the key to unlocking the full potential of site monitoring of your construction projects.

However, with changing times and the need for diversity and inclusivity, the industry is gradually moving towards greater gender balance. While there has been a slow but steady increase in the number of women in construction, it still remains a largely untapped resource.\n\nThe proportion of women in the construction industry, however, is not changing fast enough. In fact, according to Autodesk, only 7% of line executive positions in the construction sector are held by women and only 14% of females have had a career in construction, a figure which is more than double for males. These statistics show that, despite significant improvements made in the industry, female representation still has a very long way to go.\n\nAs we celebrate women’s history month, we take a look at the value women bring to the construction industry, how organisations can encourage more female representation among their workforce, and how women can best align their skills and aspirations to succeed amidst the industry.\n\nThe Value Women Bring To The Construction Industry\n\nIt has repeatedly been proven that organisations with greater diversity bring in more revenue compared to those that do not embrace it in the workforce. High-gender-diversity companies deliver better returns and have outperformed, on average, less diverse companies over the past five years.\n\nA report from McKinsey reports that highly gender-diverse companies are 25% more likely to experience above-average profitability than their less-diverse counterparts, further reinforcing the value and importance of diversity in the workplace. Businesses that not only hire but also manage to retain more women put themselves in a position to gain a competitive advantage, a benefit that extends to all stakeholders. \n\nIn addition to financial success, companies that create and shape gender-diverse workplaces gain access to a much wider talent pool from which to recruit, develop and grow. Women make up half of the global population and bring a wealth of skills, knowledge and attributes that can prove pivotal in the long-term success of businesses. \n\nFurthermore, work environments that are both diverse and inclusive gain the additional advantage of different approaches, perspectives and life experiences that organisations can utilise to embed into their products and services. A multiplicity of perspectives can help in sparking creativity and innovation, helping businesses to identify new opportunities and challenge traditional gender stereotypes simultaneously.\n\n\nEvercam team on site\n\nEvercam is a good example of an organization that has made a concerted effort to hire women from a range of backgrounds and careers, recognizing the value that diversity brings to their team. We have women from diverse backgrounds across the world who have brought new perspectives and ideas to the table. \n\nHOW CAN BUSINESSES ENCOURAGE MORE FEMALE REPRESENTATION?\n\nTwo of the biggest obstacles for women in construction are a lack of mentors and a limited number of female role models. An absence of support within the sector can have an impact on gender diversity as it can cause uncertainty for those who are interested in entering the industry. \n\nIf companies actively celebrate their female construction leaders, it will encourage more girls to pursue their interests and careers, therefore increasing the hiring pool diversity. It is important that young girls have strong role models of other successful women in STEM to demonstrate that they have the opportunity to succeed within this industry too.\n\nAs well as this, ensuring that women are in influential positions also means that they can engage their male counterparts on the topic of gender equality.\n\nWant to know more about Evercam?

DB Schenker was concerned about meeting its sustainability goals, as well as ensuring that the construction process was efficient and on schedule. To achieve these goals, DB Schenker needed a solution that would allow them to monitor the construction process in real time and document the progress towards its sustainability goals.\n\nThe Solution\n\nDB Schenker chose to make construction cameras part of their work flow during the construction process. The cameras were placed at strategic locations on the construction site and connected to a cloud-based platform. This platform allowed DB Schenker to monitor the construction process in real-time, capturing images and videos of the progress being made.\n\nThe use of construction cameras allowed DB Schenker to achieve its sustainability goals and complete the construction process on time. The real-time monitoring provided by the cameras enabled DB Schenker to quickly identify and resolve any issues that arose during the construction process, reducing the risk of project delays. The reporting feature also allowed DB Schenker to document its sustainability achievements, providing evidence of its commitment to eco-friendly construction practices.\n\nGate Report\n\nThe daily reports provided by the cameras gave DB Schenker a comprehensive overview of all vehicles entering and exiting their construction site, including the duration of their stay.\n\nThe camera, which could detect different types of vehicles made it easy for DB Schenker to focus on what mattered most. With the click of a button, DB Schenker were able to access live views of any vehicle on their site from their cloud recordings.\n\nThis data, along with the time-stamped log of all vehicles entering and exiting the site, allowed DB Schenker to validate invoices independently and avoid disputes over additional costs. The Gate Report also provided insights into material arrival and departure, allowing DB Schenker to control project costs better and use the data for future cost projections.\n\nEvercam Gate Report\n360 Internal View\n\nBy integrating with Matterport, DB Schenker was able to gain a 360 internal view of their facility, providing real-time monitoring of the construction progress and ensuring that all sustainability goals were being met. With the added benefit of the 360º View placement feature, viewers can seamlessly navigate between 360º Views and the rest of the 3D space, including outdoor shots, making them more prominent and integrated in the virtual tour.\n\nThis enhanced feature creates a more interactive and comprehensive experience for viewers, providing a more complete picture of the facility’s construction progress.\n\n360 Internal View\n360 Internal View\nDrone View\n\nEvercam uses drones to capture images and then reconstructs a model of these images, creating a comprehensive overview of the entire construction project. With Evercam’s Drone View, the visualization and annotation of the project become more accessible, allowing for a better understanding of the progress and status of the construction project.\n\nDB Schenker – Liffey Business Campus Evercam Drone View \n4D View\n\nThe fixed-position cameras were integrated with a 4D simulation software that allowed DB Schenker to visualize the construction process in real-time and ensure that the project was on schedule.\n\nDB Schenker – Liffey Business Campus Evercam 4D View \n\nDB Schenker used Evercam’s 4D Compare tool with their BIM software to compare the actual construction process with the planned construction timeline. This tool allows for a side-by-side comparison between the BIM model and live camera views, providing a visual representation of any discrepancies between the two.\n\nWith this feature, DB Schenker was able to closely monitor the construction progress and make necessary adjustments to ensure that the project stayed on track.\n\nThe Results\n\nThe use of construction cameras allowed DB Schenker to achieve its sustainability goals and complete the construction process on time. The real-time monitoring provided by the cameras enabled DB Schenker to quickly identify and resolve any issues that arose during the construction process, reducing the risk of project delays.\n\nThe reporting feature also allowed DB Schenker to document its sustainability achievements, including the following\n\nReduction in Carbon Emissions\n\nThe integration of AI in construction cameras revolutionizes the way carbon footprint is monitored on construction sites. By accurately tracking the entry and exit of vehicles, these cameras ensure that contractors remain in compliance with regulations and requirements.\n\nThe Gate Report offers contractors unparalleled control over vehicle activity, enabling them to reduce emissions, fuel consumption, and road congestion, as well as minimize noise pollution. With the ability to access live views from anywhere, contractors can monitor project progress in real-time, making it easier to achieve their sustainability goals. This helped the company to minimize its carbon footprint and contribute to a greener environment.\n\nEnergy-Efficient Technologies\n\nThe deployment of solar-powered cameras on construction sites provides a sustainable solution to the challenge of monitoring carbon footprint. These cameras rely solely on the energy from the sun, eliminating the need for cable connections or generator usage.\n\nWith no dependence on external power sources, solar-powered cameras can be easily installed in remote or hard-to-reach locations, providing a cost-effective and reliable way to monitor construction projects. It is also easier for contractors to access real-time views of the construction site and monitor progress even in the event of power disruptions.\n\nBy reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of clean energy, the use of solar-powered cameras represents a step towards a greener, more sustainable future for the construction industry.\n\nDB Schenker – Liffey Business Campus Evercam Drone View \n\nConclusion\n\nThe construction of the DB Schenker logistics facility was a complex project that required a solution to help achieve sustainability goals and ensure that the construction process was efficient and on schedule. The use of construction cameras provided real-time monitoring and documentation of the construction process, enabling DB Schenker to meet its sustainability goals and complete the project on time.\n\nThis case study demonstrates the benefits of using construction cameras in sustainable construction projects and highlights DB Schenker’s commitment to eco-friendly practices.\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Have you ever wished you had a smarter solution that not only captures defining moments in your day-to-day operations on-site but also converts them into data you can access on-demand for audit or legal purposes?\n\nEvercam is here to help with a full video recording feature that captures every second of your project. Our video documentation not only captures on-site incidents, claims, and deliveries but also allows you to review exactly what happened in full-frame rate 4K full video. With our vSaaS platform, you can monitor, manage, market, and resolve disputes all made possible with video documentation. This means you can proactively identify safety incidents or review the cause of an incident or claim. And the best part? You can access all this information on-demand for audit or legal purposes!\n\nVideo documentation is an excellent way to establish the cause of health and safety incidents on site. The full video recording feature enables clients to quickly review footage of an incident, you can identify poor practices and establish if the protocol has been followed. This not only saves time but also prevents delays that can cause site shutdowns and time-consuming investigations.\n\nVideo evidence is also crucial in disputes and claims. Without it, settlements can become expensive and hard to win. By having irrefutable video evidence, you can save money and ensure that you don’t pay for existing damage or damage done by others. Back charges and delay penalties can be avoided, and change orders from existing conditions can be supported.\n\nIn addition to resolving disputes and claims, video documentation can also enforce increased transparency in construction allowing for better planning of access routes and equipment placement, assuring owners and neighbours that their property will be protected. Full video recordings on construction sites can be a lifesaver when it comes to protecting yourself from paying for existing damage or damage done by others.\n\nThink about it – without video evidence, it’s hard to determine who caused the damage and when it happened. But with full video recordings, you can see the entire timeline of events and identify any existing damage before starting the construction work. This means you can avoid paying for damages that were already there and have proof to defend yourself against false claims.\n\nPlus, having video evidence can also encourage others to be more cautious and responsible on-site, leading to a safer and more efficient work environment. So, not only can full video recordings save you money, but they can also promote a culture of accountability and responsibility on-site.\n\nFull video recordings on construction sites can be an effective tool to reduce or prevent re-work. By capturing all activities and movements on-site, the videos provide a detailed record of the project’s progress. This record can help identify any issues that arise during construction and allow the project team to take corrective action to prevent re-work.\n\nWith video evidence, the team can review the footage to determine the root cause of the problem and use that information to implement the necessary changes to avoid similar issues in the future. This helps save time and money that would have been spent on re-work, thereby increasing project efficiency and profitability.\n\nOverall, full video recordings can be an invaluable resource for any construction project seeking to minimize re-work and ensure a successful outcome.\n\nBy recording all construction in full video, construction managers can upskill their teams through knowledge management and training. Virtual QA/QC meetings can be held, improving communication to identify potential issues before they happen. Back checks of materials used or orders can be done, and change order verification can be supported. By solving facilities problems down the road and verifying if a problem is a systemic or isolated issue, without doing destructive verification, you can increase productivity and reduce rework.\n\nConstruction collaboration can also be enhanced through video documentation. Faster mobilization of team members in case of changes or emergencies can be achieved, and earlier/more timely stakeholder involvement in critical decisions can be established. Fewer drawing revisions can be made, and more accurate bidding can be done. Problem-solving can be faster, and construction safety compliance can be improved, leading to less rework.\n\nVideo documentation is a must-have for any construction project. Through Evercam’s platform, you can effectively monitor the progress and safety of your site, boost productivity, and improve collaboration between team members. Being able to review these recordings improves customer relations by providing an observable record of the development trajectory – and will help reduce legal disputes as well.\n\nMoreover, this type of technological solution not only gives you an assurance that issues are identified and addressed in time but also helps to protect both your team members and your customer’s interests in construction projects.

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nFaith Tangara\n\nConstruction Writer\nDate : 15-04-2023 Last Modified Date : 28-04-2023\n   \nDissecting Technology’s Shortcomings in the Construction Sector & The Open Source Alternative\n\nThe construction industry is often considered to be one of the slowest industries to adopt new technologies. Despite the abundance of innovative technologies available, the construction sector has remained largely reliant on traditional methods, with many processes still carried out manually.\n\nThis lack of adoption of new technologies has resulted in slower project delivery times, increased costs, and a lack of transparency across the industry. However, this lack of progress is not only due to a lack of effort or investment by the industry but also is the result of technology providers not understanding the construction process and failing to sell a vision that is in tandem with it.\n\nWhile the tech boom continues to be witnessed on a large scale, the pursuit to develop tools that are in line with construction processes has been a challenge, especially for technology providers who, in most cases, may not fully understand the construction process and the complexities involved in managing a construction project.  For example, they may not be familiar with the various regulatory requirements and safety standards that must be met, or they may not understand the nuances of scheduling and sequencing construction activities.\n\nTechnology providers must be able to sell a vision that goes hand in hand with the construction process. This means not only demonstrating the benefits of the technology but also communicating how it will fit within the industry and improve the current workflow. This requires a deep understanding of the construction process and the ability to communicate the benefits of the technology in a way that resonates with industry stakeholders.\n\n\n\nA key challenge that technology providers face is the industry’s highly fragmented nature, with numerous players involved in each project, including contractors, subcontractors, architects, engineers, and owners. This complexity can make it difficult to implement new technologies, as different players may have different requirements and priorities.\n\nThe unique nature of construction projects often requires customization and adaptation to specific site conditions and client needs. This can make it challenging to apply off-the-shelf solutions to construction problems, as each project may require a unique approach. Any new technology solution must, therefore, not only provide clear benefits but also fit within the existing workflow and processes. Failure to consider these factors often leads to a lack of adoption of new technologies, even if they offer clear advantages over existing methods.\n\nConstruction projects are complex and require careful planning, coordination, and execution of numerous tasks and activities. The success of a construction project depends on meeting deadlines, staying within budget, and delivering a high-quality product that meets the requirements and specifications of the project owner. Given these requirements, construction projects cannot be put on hold to wait for software or technological advancement.\n\nThe construction industry requires innovative solutions that can help improve the efficiency and productivity of the construction process without compromising the project’s timeline or quality. Therefore, technology providers must understand the unique challenges and requirements of the construction industry and develop solutions that can seamlessly integrate into the existing workflow and contribute to the success of the project.\n\n\nSource: Buildipedia\n\nIntegrated project delivery (IPD) is a collaborative approach to construction project management that involves all stakeholders from design to construction. The goal of IPD is to break down the silos between each stakeholder and create a seamless, integrated process that focuses on delivering a high-quality project on time and within budget.\n\nTechnology has not yet fully embraced the concept of IPD, as most solutions are designed for a specific stakeholder in the construction process. This siloed approach to technology limits the potential benefits of technology in the construction industry and creates inefficiencies and miscommunication between stakeholders.\n\nTo realize the full potential of technology in the construction industry, there needs to be a shift towards a more integrated approach that supports IPD. Technology providers must develop solutions that can support the entire construction process, from design to delivery. These solutions must be flexible enough to accommodate the needs and requirements of each stakeholder, while still providing a seamless and integrated process.\n\nTherefore, the construction industry must adopt open-source solutions that are designed to help meet its needs. Open standards and the use of accessible software can improve collaboration and efficiency in the construction industry. Open-source software is designed to be flexible, and customizable to fit the unique needs of the industry. It provides a cost-effective alternative to proprietary software while allowing for easy integration and collaboration among different stakeholders.\n\nOpen-source collaboration is a promising approach for construction teams to work more efficiently by providing a centralized platform for communication, file sharing, and real-time collaboration. Unlike proprietary software use, open-source tools are publicly accessible and free to use, without any subscription fees or licensing costs.\n\nThe use of open-source collaboration tools promotes interoperability between different software systems too, avoiding being locked into proprietary software systems that can limit collaboration and innovation. Moreover, open-source collaboration tools can enable construction teams to share information and data more securely and efficiently.\n\nInstead of relying on email or physical documents, all project-related information can be stored and accessed in a centralized repository. This allows team members to easily access and share information in real time, leading to faster decision-making and improved project outcomes.\n\nAs a player in the self-same construction industry, it is our duty to not only recommend ways to improve technology adoption in the industry but to also contribute. In our scope, Evercam offers open reality capture as one of its key features. One of the main benefits of Evercam’s open reality capture is its API access, which allows developers to access and integrate the captured data with other software tools, resulting in a more comprehensive project management experience.\n\nEvercam’s technology can easily be assimilated with your existing construction management software such as Procore, Autodesk BIM 360, PowerBI, Zutec, Sharepoint, and Aconex. This integration enables the streamlined transfer of data and minimizes friction throughout the project. Evercam also provides a streamlined communication system, allowing users to add images to snag lists, observations, or RFIs.\n\nEvercam’s open reality capture presents an opportunity for construction teams to enhance their project management capabilities by providing them with insights that can lead to better decision-making.

In this article, we will delve deeper into the role of reality capture in project management and collaboration, shedding light on its essential contributions to successful outcomes in the construction industry.\n\nA Closer Look at Reality Capture and BIM Integration\nReality Capture\n\nReality Capture involves gathering accurate data about physical spaces or objects and transforming them into digital 3D models. This technology employs various methods, including 3D laser scanning, photogrammetry, and drone surveying, to provide accurate measurements, contours, and site conditions. This precise information facilitates informed decision-making, effective planning, and accurate designing.\n\nBuilding Information Modeling (BIM)\n\nBIM offers a digital representation of a facility’s physical and functional characteristics, providing an invaluable resource for decision-making throughout the facility’s life cycle. Unlike the traditional 2D blueprint, BIM integrates dimensions of time (4D) and enhances collaboration among project stakeholders. \n\nhttps://vimeo.com/682915598\nEvercam’s BIM integration illustration\n\nWhen combined with reality capture, construction professionals can obtain precise as-built information, detect clashes or discrepancies between the design and the actual site conditions, and make informed decisions in real time. This integration not only improves project coordination and reduces errors but also enables effective project scheduling and visualisation, leading to greater efficiency and improved project outcomes.\n\nChallenges in Project Progress Management\nLack of Real-Time Information\n\nTraditional project management heavily relies on periodic site visits and manual data collection. This approach can result in a lack of real-time information about the project’s status and progress. The delays in obtaining crucial information can constrain decision-making and increase the chances of errors. Without immediate access to accurate data, project managers may struggle to stay updated on the current state of the project, which can lead to inefficiencies and setbacks.\n\nCommunication Gaps\n\nEffective communication is vital for successful project management. However, without a unified platform to share information, miscommunication can occur between project teams. This can happen when different stakeholders rely on disparate systems or use outdated communication channels. The lack of a centralised information-sharing platform can lead to delays, misunderstandings, and errors. Important project details may be miscommunicated or not communicated at all, resulting in rework, schedule disruptions, and potential cost overruns.\n\nComplex Construction Sequencing\n\nConstruction projects involve sequences of activities that need to be carefully coordinated for smooth progress. Managing these complex sequences without appropriate visualisation and analysis tools can be challenging. Understanding the dependencies and interrelationships between different tasks becomes difficult, which can lead to costly delays. Without a clear overview of the construction sequencing, project managers may struggle to optimise workflows, identify bottlenecks, and make informed decisions to ensure efficient progress.\n\nEvercam’s Reality Capture features, including 4D View, BIM Compare, and Drone View, offer benefits to construction site visualization.

Moreover, the ability of drones to perform these tasks without endangering human lives greatly enhances safety on construction sites.\n\nThe Evercam Drone has been used in various practical scenarios demonstrating its versatility and utility.\n\nFor instance, the Project Manager used the drone during meetings with the site team and subcontractors to highlight areas to be cleaned and compacted to install a crane. At the deadline, he switched to the camera live view to verify if the task was done. Without the drone, this would have required manual inspection, which could be time-consuming.\nWhen the temporary stock materials area needed to move to another location, the drone was used to quickly measure the surface and look for another location within the same area. Without the drone, this would have required manual measurement and visual inspection, which could be more time-consuming.\nIn yet another instance, the drone was used to highlight an area, took a screenshot of it, and sent it to all the employees to ask them not to park there while some work was being done. Without the drone, this would have required physical presence on site, individual communication and manual monitoring, which could be less efficient and effective.\nProject Progress Tracking\n\nKeeping track of a construction project’s progress can be a challenging task, especially for large-scale projects. Drones can help overcome this challenge by providing a bird’s eye view of the construction site. Regular drone flights can capture images and videos that can be used to create time-lapse footage, providing stakeholders with a clear and comprehensive overview of the project’s progress. This not only facilitates better project management but also enhances communication with clients, as they can visually see the progress being made.\n\nImproving Safety and Compliance\n\nSafety is a paramount concern in the construction industry. Drones can contribute significantly to enhancing safety by identifying potential hazards and ensuring compliance with safety regulations. For instance, drones can monitor the proper use of safety equipment, adherence to safety protocols, and the safe storage of materials. Furthermore, in the event of an accident, drones can be used to assess the situation and plan the appropriate response, minimising risks to rescue teams.\n\nAs demonstrated by the use cases, the use of drones in the construction industry is a transformative development, offering a number of benefits that enhance efficiency, safety, and communication while reducing costs. As drone technology continues to evolve, it is poised to play an even more significant role in shaping the future of the construction industry.\n\nIn light of these advancements, it is crucial for construction companies to embrace this technology and explore its potential.

This ongoing engagement is vital for overcoming the challenges of digital transformation.\n\nIntegral to these communities are the ‘BIM Heroes‘, individuals who push boundaries and drive change within their organizations. They are not just technologists or innovators, but change agents who understand that digital transformation is about people, processes, and culture, not just technology. They are willing to take risks, challenge conventional wisdom, and drive change.\n\nThe Challenge of Silos\n\nA significant challenge in the construction industry is the existence of functional and technological silos, where different departments, teams, or systems work in isolation, leading to inefficiencies and communication issues. Overcoming these challenges involves fostering a culture of collaboration and information sharing through collaborative platforms, integrated systems, and open standards. Breaking down these silos can enhance coordination, reduce errors, and increase efficiency.\n\nMentorship\n\nMentorship plays a vital role in an organization. It can encompass various forms, including direct observation of senior members’ workflows or providing the responsibility of onboarding and training in new technologies to younger staff. \n\nA prevalent challenge in introducing new technologies to an organization is resistance from employees who may perceive it as irrelevant or unnecessary. To overcome this, appointing an internal guide can be effective. This individual can showcase the benefits of the new technology, such as potential time and cost savings, as well as improvements in safety. \n\nDigital Collaboration\n\nModern technology has transformed traditional mentorship, allowing knowledge and information to be shared on a global scale, overcoming geographical and temporal constraints. Asynchronous communication tools facilitate this process, accommodating cultural differences, languages, and varying work schedules. Companies can build a knowledge-rich environment by sharing problem-solving processes, such as through videos, fostering training and problem-solving.\n\nTechnologies like Google Glass and drones are being used in sectors like manufacturing for remote mentorship and problem inspection. This results in a global knowledge-sharing platform, promoting a more comprehensive worldview through interactions with individuals from various regions.\n\nInternational conferences can act as catalysts for this sharing, providing exposure and networking opportunities for startups, potentially leading to a fusion of best global practices and driving innovation. The transferred knowledge should not only serve immediate needs but also be preserved for future generations and projects, ensuring a continuous and self-sustaining learning cycle. \n\nProject Optimisation\n\nCurrent construction practices often treat each project as unique, failing to incorporate lessons from previous experiences. However, treating each project as a digital prototype for the next can foster continuous improvement. Knowledge transfer is key in this, as exemplified in building data centers where past experiences and solutions can be documented and shared to enhance future projects’ efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nTechnology aids this knowledge transfer, with tools like video calls and virtual walkthroughs offering insights into past projects. Counteracting arguments against standardization in construction due to building uniqueness, it’s argued that building components are standardized and lessons from their assembly can be applied to future projects, creating a cycle of improvement.\n\nThis knowledge transfer extends to project managers, construction teams, and suppliers, assisting with location-specific challenges. Modern technology can document processes and analyze data to identify best practices.\n\nMedia like podcasts can amplify knowledge exchange and stimulate wider discussions. Continuous learning and self-improvement are vital in the ever-changing construction and design world, necessitating a commitment to learning, openness to new ideas, and dedication to improvement, all facilitated by technology and knowledge transfer.\n\nThe construction industry is on the cusp of a digital revolution, but achieving its full potential hinges on people’s focus, promoting a culture of learning, collaboration, and empowering individuals. This dynamic approach is critical for the construction industry’s future.\n\nThe Future of Construction\n\nThe future of construction lies not in technology itself, but in how we use it. By focusing on learning, collaboration, and community, we can harness the power of technology to drive change and improve outcomes.\n\nThis requires a shift in mindset, from a reactive approach to a proactive one. Instead of using technology to fix problems after they occur, we should use it to prevent problems from occurring in the first place. This means using tools like BIM and reality capture to plan and coordinate projects, rather than just to document them.\n\nIt also means using technology to improve communication and collaboration. By sharing information in real time, teams can coordinate their efforts, resolve issues quickly, and make better decisions. This can lead to improved productivity, reduced costs, and better project outcomes.\n\n———————————\n\nThis blog is an extension of the BIM Heroes Podcast hosted by Cody Whitelock, a virtual construction manager at Barnhill Contracting in the US.

It ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and accurate understanding of the project’s status, which in turn facilitates informed decision-making, timely interventions, and efficient resource allocation.\n\nEnhanced visibility provides a common platform for team members to communicate, share updates, and collaborate, thereby promoting a culture of transparency and accountability.\n\nBest Practices for Improving Construction Visibility\n\nEnhancing visibility is a concern within the construction industry, as it directly impacts safety, efficiency, and project outcomes. Some of the best practices have been established to promote better visibility on construction sites.\n\n1. Regular Site Assessments: Conducting routine checks and inspections serve as proactive measures to identify potential issues before they escalate into significant problems. By monitoring progress, safety conditions, and regulatory compliance, construction professionals can promptly detect and address any concerns, thus ensuring the project’s success while mitigating risks.\n2. Educating Workers: Hosting training sessions is essential to instil a sense of responsibility among construction personnel regarding proper visibility and safety. Workers must be made aware of the risks associated with poor visibility and the best practices to uphold. This knowledge empowers workers to contribute to a safer work environment and reduces the likelihood of accidents or injuries.\n\n \n\n3. Utilising Advanced Technologies: Utilise camera systems, drones, and real-time project management software to monitor hard-to-see areas and gain aerial views of the site. Such tools serve to monitor hard-to-see areas and provide aerial views of the construction site. For example, drones equipped with high-resolution cameras can capture comprehensive site imagery, which is then integrated into real-time project management software.\n\nThis combination enables project managers to remotely access issues in inaccessible areas, make informed decisions, and enhance project management without compromising worker safety.\n\nEvercam: Advanced Construction Visibility\n\nEvercam, with its extensive reach across in over 14 countries, is spearheading the enhancement of construction productivity by improving project visibility and team communications.

The Evercam platform offers features like Gate Report for traffic control and dispute resolution, 4D BIM for planning versus reality analysis, and Drone View for detailed site assessment, among others, facilitating a comprehensive view of construction projects in real time.\n\nAdvanced Monitoring Solutions \n\nLive View, a real-time site monitoring feature, enables project stakeholders to gain immediate visual insights into ongoing construction operations. This real-time visibility optimizes site visits and fosters greater accountability within the team, making it possible to make timely decisions and address emerging issues. It ensures that construction progress remains aligned with project schedules and objectives.\n\nHigh-Resolution Recording plays a pivotal role in documenting construction projects comprehensively. It captures minute details of the construction process, ensuring that every essential aspect is recorded for thorough project assessment. This, in turn, enhances visibility by providing a wealth of data for project analysis and quality control.\n\nSecure Sharing facilitates efficient and secure communication by enabling the sharing of live or recorded footage with key project stakeholders. This ensures that all relevant parties are consistently informed and aware of the latest developments, contributing to synchronized project management and improved construction visibility.\n\nThe Zoom feature offers an even closer examination of construction activities, providing up to 18X zoom capabilities. This level of detail enables project stakeholders to identify issues and verify work quality, further improving visibility into the intricacies of the construction process.\n\nVehicle Analytics: Evercam’s Gate Report automates and tracks vehicle movements on the construction site. This aids in traffic planning and logistics optimization, contributing to efficient construction operations and enhancing overall site visibility.\n\nEnhanced construction visibility, enabled by advanced solutions significantly improves project management efficiency.

From the start, I felt I could make a real difference.”\n\nErika’s journey into marketing began with a spark of curiosity and a passion for understanding the forces driving business growth. As the Head of Marketing at Evercam, she leads innovative strategies that elevate the brand and transform the construction technology sector. Here’s her story.\n\nWhat inspired you to pursue a career in marketing?\n\nMy passion for marketing started during my first internship as a lead generation executive for a B2C company. During that experience, I discovered the dynamic and impactful nature of marketing in a business. What I love most about marketing is its constantly changing nature, which keeps things exciting and challenging. I love adapting and coming up with new ideas.\n\nOverall, I’m really happy with this career. It has allowed me to develop a wide range of skills, and each campaign is an opportunity to learn something new and contribute to the bigger picture, which I find truly fulfilling.\n\nHow challenging is it to market for the Construction Industry within a technology business?\n\nIn the construction industry, long-term benefits and reliability are highly valued. This means our marketing strategy must focus on practical and strategic advantages that can last in the long run—adding another layer of complexity to our efforts. Also, being a woman in a senior role in a foreign country presents its own set of challenges. The construction industry remains predominantly male, and breaking into this space wasn’t easy. I’ve had to overcome numerous barriers and earn trust, often as the only woman in the room. It required great resilience and confidence in my expertise to push through stereotypes and prove my worth.\n\nWhile marketing for the construction industry is challenging, it’s also incredibly rewarding. Bridging the gap between traditional methods and modern solutions demands a creative and strategic approach, making each success even more meaningful.\n\nWhat do you like most  about Evercam? \n\nWhat I love most about Evercam is the strong sense of belonging and the company culture. It’s been an amazing journey to be with Evercam for the last six years, watching it grow from its early days to becoming a global powerhouse. Seeing the company evolve and knowing I’ve played a part in that journey is incredibly fulfilling.\n\nAnother aspect I really appreciate is the opportunity to bring new ideas and test them out. It’s refreshing to know that you have the freedom to innovate and your creativity is valued.\n\nOverall, the combination of a supportive culture, the chance to make a real impact, and the management of an incredible team make Evercam such a great place to work.\n\n \n\nWhat do you find most fascinating about the construction industry?\n\nAnother aspect I love is teamwork. Construction projects bring together diverse/multiple professionals—architects, engineers, project managers, and labourers—working towards a common goal. There’s a great sense of collaboration and shared accomplishment when you see the finished product.\n\nOn a broader scale, it’s incredibly rewarding to be part of something that physically shapes our communities and environments. Knowing that our work can have a lasting impact and serve future generations is highly motivating.\n\nCan you share the moment you realized you were making a significant impact at Evercam?\n\nI started at Evercam as the first marketing person in a team of one. From the start, I felt I could make a real difference. A standout moment was when I built the video team from scratch, turning it into a powerful resource and a revenue-generating department. This was a huge milestone for me in terms of managing and leading people to achieve great things.\n\nOver the past few years, shaping the content and video teams has been a significant part of my role. Seeing these teams grow and thrive has been incredibly rewarding. Leading a marketing team of 17 people is a testament to hard work and dedication. Looking back, it’s amazing to see how far we’ve come and to know that I played a significant role in that journey.\n\nWhat are your top priorities to ensure high performance and exceptional results?\n\n\nFirst, having a clear strategy and goals is crucial. We need to know exactly what we’re aiming for, whether it’s boosting brand awareness, generating leads, or driving sales. Clear, measurable objectives help everyone stay focused and aligned.\n\nNext, keeping the team connected is essential. Regular check-ins, team meetings, and constant communication make sure we’re all on the same page and can tackle any issues early on. Good communication is the backbone of successful teamwork.\n\nAnother key aspect is investing in the team’s growth. Offering training opportunities and promoting continuous learning keeps everyone motivated and up-to-date with the latest trends.\n\nMost importantly, our focus is always on our customers. Understanding their needs and preferences helps us create marketing strategies that truly resonate and add value.\n\nHow does it feel to be part of Evercam’s brand transition from Cameras to a leading Construction Visibility Platform?\n\nEvercam has grown from providing construction cameras for time-lapse videos to becoming the market leader with its Construction Visibility Platform. It’s been amazing to be part of this journey. Our marketing team has played a significant role in communicating these changes, such as highlighting our new site capture solutions and advanced monitoring technology, using multiple channels like social media, newsletters, and industry events. Also, collaboration with our product and customer success teams has been key to tailoring our messaging to meet customer needs and reflect Evercam’s technical capabilities.\n\nWhat storytelling techniques do you find most effective when creating video content for the construction industry?\n\nIt’s all about telling real stories and making our customers the protagonists of our work. I always tell the team that they are the superheroes, and we are the real-life Robins. Making sure our customers are the stars is the first step to creating great content.\n\n Visual progress is key, and time-lapse videos are a fantastic way to capture the progress of a project over time. They look impressive and provide a clear, visual representation of the work being done, showcasing efficiency and scale.\n\nEvery project has a story—from the initial planning stages to the final build. Crafting a narrative that includes the project’s goals, challenges, and successes takes the audience on a journey and makes the content more engaging. Highlighting the human element is essential. Construction is ultimately about people—whether it’s the workers on the site, the clients, or the communities benefiting from the project. Focusing on the human aspect makes the content more relatable and emotional.\n\nFinally, it is important to keep the content concise and focused. Construction professionals are often busy, so ensuring the videos are informative yet concise helps retain their attention. Also, seeing our videos on LinkedIn is just amazing!\n\nFrom your experience, how can construction companies best utilize time-lapse videos to showcase their projects effectively?\n\nTime-lapse videos are an invaluable tool for construction companies. We offer our customers our Time-lapse Pro service, which includes professionally edited videos that highlight key milestones. By focusing on significant construction stages like groundbreaking, major structural completions, and finishing touches, companies can effectively tell a visual story of the project’s development and the critical milestones achieved along the way.\n\nIncorporating these videos into your marketing materials and presentations adds a dynamic element that can be very compelling. They work great on your website, social media, and during client meetings, showcasing your capabilities and expertise in an informative and engaging way.\n\nSharing time-lapse videos with stakeholders, including clients, investors, and the community, keeps everyone informed and engaged with the project’s progress, building trust and transparency as stakeholders can visually see the progress being made.\n\nIf you could go back in time and give advice to your younger self just starting out in marketing, what would it be?\n\nIf I could go back in time, I would tell myself to enjoy the journey and embrace continuous learning. I’d also emphasize the importance of building strong relationships, both within your team and with clients. Networking and collaboration are key. \n\nI would also remind myself to always be kind to others and myself, and to keep a smile on my face—which I always do!\n\nHow do you ensure continuous growth and learning in your career?\n\nI love discussing new trends, especially in innovation. Listening to podcasts is one of my go-to channels for personal and professional growth. There’s so much amazing, free content out there that I often wish I had a few more hours in my day just to consume it all. By staying curious and proactive in my learning, I ensure that I’m always evolving and staying ahead in my career.\n\n \n\nLearn more\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Her journey reveals the layers of her career, from the tactile art of drafting designs to the strategic oversight of product development. Through her eyes, we see the contours of a profession that is as much about understanding the needs of clients as it is about the nuts and bolts of building structures and software.\n\nIn this candid conversation, Mia reflects on the projects that have shaped her, the role of AI in her former field, and the surprising twists her career has taken. Her story unfolds as an exploration of how professional growth often requires a blend of skills and the courage to step into new roles. As we dive into her professional life, Mia offers a glimpse into how the core principles of design and architecture can find new life in product management, and how the focus on user experience remains at the heart of innovation.\n\n \n\nHow long have you been working as an architect, and what has been one of your most memorable projects?\n\nI have been in the field of architecture for close to ten years now. My journey began in 2012 when I graduated and started to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world scenarios. Becoming a licensed architect two years later marked the true beginning of my professional identity in this field. Among the array of projects that I’ve had the privilege to work on, the design competition for the Qatar Embassy in Manila stands out. It wasn’t just a project. It was a race against time—a symphony of creative minds in sync. Winning that design competition was a career highlight, testing my collaborative and innovative skills under tight deadlines.\n\nDo you miss working in architecture, and what’s a surprising fact about your professional background?\n\nThere are moments when the nostalgia for the pure architectural design process washes over me. The initial stages of ideation and creativity, where a concept takes its first breath, are unparalleled. However, these moments of longing are balanced by the excitement of my current role. \n\nNot widely known is that I am a WELL-accredited professional emphasizing the health and well-being of building occupants—a principle growing in significance for our spaces. I also serve as the VP for Programs and Development in my local chapter, the Las Pinas Chapter, under the United Architects of the Philippines. This role also keeps me occupied during weekends.\n\nWas AI integrated into your work previously and what inspired the transition from architecture to product management?\n\nInterestingly, my architectural work remained untouched by AI, which seemed to be weaving into every other profession. We prided ourselves on our manual, tactile approach to design, believing that the human touch was integral to our craft. But the winds of change blew when I was introduced to the concept of product management. Initially, it appeared to be a tangential move into project management. Soon, I realized it involved stepping into a space where technology, integrated with Building Information Modeling (BIM), extends beyond the design phase into construction. The potential to drive innovation was irresistible, and thus, I ventured into product management.\n\nHow does your architectural background influence product management, and how do you prioritize features when developing products?\n\nMy experience in architecture has equipped me with a unique lens through which I view product management. The core principles of understanding user needs, contextualizing problems, and crafting tailored solutions are common to both fields. When it comes to feature prioritization, it’s like determining the critical path in a construction project. I engage in thorough discussions with the development team, weigh the expected impact against the effort, and utilize a scoring system that helps us align our priorities with strategic business outcomes and customer satisfaction.\n\nHave client feedback and sustainable architecture principles led to any significant changes in product development?\n\nAbsolutely, client feedback is the compass that guides the evolution of our products. A striking example was when we transitioned from using static images to incorporating live video feeds in our product offerings. This shift was a direct response to the market’s demand for more interactive and engaging content. In parallel, the precepts of sustainable architecture—long-term value creation, resource conservation, and resilience—mirror the ethos of product development. We strive to build products that stand the test of time, use resources judiciously, and deliver continuous value to our customers.\n\nWhich iconic architectural masterpiece do you wish you could’ve observed through an Evercam from start to finish? If Evercam could time-travel, which architect/building/project from the past would you want to collaborate with?\n\nGiven the chance, I would choose to time-lapse the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona from start to finish. The idea of capturing every moment of this architectural marvel’s century-long construction is nothing short of an architect’s dream. \n\nIf Evercam had the ability to reach into the past, I would be thrilled to collaborate with Imhotep, the first known architect, to document the construction of the earliest monumental buildings in ancient Egypt. Observing these historical milestones through the lens of modern technology would be an exceptional bridge between the ancient and the contemporary, showcasing the timeless nature of architectural innovation.\n\nHow do you prioritize features, especially when balancing the demands of different stakeholders like owners, construction managers, and tech teams?\n\nPrioritizing features in product management requires a careful balancing act, considering both the potential value a feature brings and the feasibility of its implementation. We assess how each feature aligns with our product vision and its overall impact on our customer base. It’s not just about catering to a specific client’s needs but ensuring that the feature adds substantial value for all users. Furthermore, we evaluate the resources and effort required for development, considering our tech team’s capabilities. This approach of weighing both value and effort helps us to prioritize features that offer the most significant benefit while being realistically achievable.\n\nHow do you ensure products remain user-friendly, and what role do you see AI playing in construction management?\n\nUser-friendliness is the cornerstone of product design. Ensuring that our products are intuitive requires a concerted effort across multidisciplinary teams. Regular user testing, feedback loops, and iterative design processes are vital. As for AI in construction management, its role is set to be transformative. AI can streamline operations and offer data-driven insights. However, it will augment rather than replace the nuanced decision-making and creative problem-solving that human managers bring to the table.\n\nWhich architectural principle is most important for user experience in product development?\n\nThe architectural principle of ‘form follows function‘ is deeply ingrained in user experience for product development. The aesthetic value must go hand-in-hand with usability and relevance. \n\nCan you share a memorable experience from your architectural studies and describe how architecture influences your personal life?\n\nOne profound takeaway from my studies was the realization that architecture is not just about buildings—it’s about people. A professor once said, “We don’t just build spaces; we shape lives.” This principle has stayed with me, guiding my approach to product management as well. \n\nIn my personal life, architecture’s influence is omnipresent. I’ve always been passionate about design, including fashion, interiors, architecture, and graphics. Planning comes naturally to me, whether it’s organizing my day, choosing what to wear (with a focus on aesthetics), or contemplating home improvements and design ideas. I’m continually assessing spaces for both functionality and aesthetics, and this extends to my appreciation for structural elements in fashion design.\n\nDo you have a favourite building that you’d like as a miniature model?\n\nWhile I appreciate the grandeur of many iconic structures, a miniature model of my family home would be my pick. It’s a symbol of personal history and emotional connection, reminding me of where my journey began.\n\nDo you have hobbies outside of design and architecture?\n\nCertainly! Recently, I’ve discovered the joys and challenges of yoga and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). They offer a stark contrast to the cerebral and often sedentary nature of my profession. Yoga provides a sense of balance and inner calm, while HIIT is all about energy and endurance. Both activities have become essential for my physical well-being and mental clarity, allowing me to return to my professional pursuits with renewed vigour and a fresh perspective.\n\nMia’s transition from creating physical structures to shaping digital products exemplifies the versatility and cross-disciplinary applications of architectural principles. Her experiences emphasize the importance of staying receptive to new opportunities and showcase the exciting possibilities that emerge when one is willing to venture beyond traditional career paths.\n\nMia’s story is a testament to the synergies between architecture and product management, and it serves as an inspiration for professionals striving to broaden their horizons while making a meaningful impact in their industries.\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

    "html": "  Ireland \nIR \nUK \nSG \nAU \nUS \nPL \n  Sign in      Contact      +353 1 919 4500\nSolutions\nProjects\nPricing\nCompany\nResources\nRequest a demo\nFaith Tangara\n\nConstruction Writer\nDate : 17-09-2024\n   \nVoices of Evercam: Meet Amina Salesse – Data Quality Team Lead\n“Behind every successful project is reliable data. I take pride in making sure it’s there, every single time”\n\nIn this edition of Voices of Evercam, we introduce Amina Salesse, our Data Quality Team Lead. With a background in the oil and gas industry, Amina brings unique insights into data quality management, particularly in construction camera monitoring. We’ll explore her journey, hear her thoughts on the importance of data quality in AI-driven processes, and learn about her mentorship work, her passion for diversity, and how she balances it all.\n\nCan you share some details about your professional background?\n\nSure! In my previous role, in oil and gas, I was involved in monitoring real-time operations. Sometimes, issues arise unexpectedly, and I’d have to step in, find the client, and suggest adjustments or corrections. It was quite intense but fascinating. My desk was like a command center with 10 screens showing different diagrams, parameters, and situations. I’d constantly switch between screens, keeping an eye on major events. These could range from something minor to something as serious as a blowout, like in the movie Deepwater Horizon. The stakes were high because it wasn’t just about drilling; it was about the safety of everyone on site. Safety was always the top priority.\n\nHow did your career transition from oil and gas to Construction Technology?\n\nIt was a challenging transition. After my father fell ill, I left my oil and gas job and returned to Algiers to care for him. Following his passing, I struggled with depression and needed a change that required less interaction with people. That’s when my brother mentioned a company looking for a Data Quality Engineer. The job was simpler than what I was used to, which was good for my mental state at the time. But as I started feeling better, I realized I wanted more—more development and more challenges.\n\nInitially, I was just trying to figure things out, solving issues as they came up and reporting on them. Over time, I became more involved in problem-solving and eventually was asked to lead the Data Quality (DQ) team. This role allowed me to improve the accuracy and structure of our data, which has been incredibly fulfilling.\n\nCan you discuss some of the key projects you’ve worked on at Evercam and their impact?\n\nOne of the main projects I’ve been involved with is enhancing our platform’s structure and efficiency, making it a powerful tool for construction management. I’ve also worked on developing products and integrating technologies to enhance visualization and construction data analytics. These projects have significantly expanded Evercam’s capabilities, allowing us to provide our clients with clear insights based on visual data.\n\nWas your experience in oil and gas tech-oriented? How does it compare to your current role?\n\nThe oil and gas industry was tech-oriented, but I wasn’t as involved in the tech side of things. My focus was more on physical parameters like pressure, lithology, and the geology of the rock formations we were drilling into. I wasn’t programming or coding. However, when I joined Evercam, I had to learn how to communicate with developers, which was a new challenge. Engineers and developers think differently; engineers solve physical problems, while developers often follow the principle of “if it works, don’t fix it.” It took some time, but I learned how to bridge that gap, and how to communicate issues in a way that both developers and clients could understand.\n\nWhat skills from your previous roles do you find most valuable now?\n\nMy previous job was all about supporting the client—understanding their issues and providing solutions. That’s exactly what I do now in my current role. Whether it’s helping clients understand a problem or making sure we don’t repeat the same mistakes, it’s all about communication and problem-solving. I used to analyze numbers to identify issues, and I do the same now but with data from our AI models and construction cameras. I apply the problem-solving mindset every day at Evercam.\n\n\t\nWhat’s a typical day like for you at Evercam?\n\nEvery day, there’s a new issue on my desk. I’m the focal point for these problems, deciding which team should handle what—whether it’s site operations, the DQ team, or IT. I don’t fix the issues myself, but I know who to go to and how to communicate the solution to the client. This involves a lot of communication, organization, and problem-solving; making sure nothing gets overlooked. Good communication is key here because sometimes I’m not talking to an engineer; I might talk to a project manager who doesn’t understand the technical details. My job is to make sure everyone is on the same page. The day can be full of challenges, but it’s also rewarding to see issues being effectively managed and clients being satisfied with our solutions.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a big buzzword in the industry right now. How does Evercam use AI to improve its processes?\n\nAI enables us to provide intelligent, real-time monitoring. We use several AI models to improve the accuracy of our data. The AI helps in analyzing visual data and ensuring that the information we provide is as accurate as possible. However, AI isn’t perfect, which is where our DQ team comes in. We have a dedicated DQ team that verifies the data, flags issues, and feeds corrected data back into the AI models. This process helps improve the AI’s accuracy over time and ensures that our clients receive the most reliable information. So, it’s this combination of human oversight and AI efficiency that really boosts the value of our products.\n\nWhat are your aspirations for the future of Evercam?\n\nI’m excited about Evercam’s potential to bring change in the construction industry through construction camera technology.  I’m passionate about our mission to empower companies to build better, safer, and more efficient projects. I’m confident that by continuing to invest in innovation and user-centric design, Evercam will continue to lead the charge in this exciting new era of construction technology.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the importance of data quality and verification in AI-driven processes?\n\nData quality is the backbone of any AI-driven process. Without high-quality data, even the most sophisticated AI models can produce unreliable results. At Evercam, we approach this in three ways. First, our DQ team verifies the data and provides a finalized report to clients. Second, any issues with cameras or AI are flagged and addressed promptly to prevent data loss. Lastly, our DQ team feeds corrected data back into the AI models, to improve their accuracy over time. This ongoing process ensures that our product remains reliable and continues to improve.\n\nWhat are the most exciting developments at Evercam right now?\n\nCurrently, we’re excited about several developments, including the integration of new technologies as primary detection sources. We’ve also enhanced the user interface, making it more intuitive and user-friendly for our clients. Additionally, we’re using advanced AI models and third-party APIs to improve the accuracy of our data. These updates make our platform a more powerful tool for monitoring construction sites and ensuring that our clients have the most accurate and reliable data at their fingertips..\n\nHow does Evercam differ from other construction monitoring solutions in the market?\n\nOne of our key strengths is providing real-time data, which may not always be the case with other solutions. We also understand that every job site has its own unique characteristics. So we treat each project in its special way. We also have a dedicated DQ team behind our AI. Many people think AI can handle everything independently, but it’s still learning. At Evercam, we have a team that monitors, corrects, and feeds the AI, ensuring it delivers accurate data. We have several teams working together such as Site Ops team, an IT team, an AI team, a UI team, my DQ team, and a customer success team.\n\nIt’s interesting to hear about the dedication put into each project. You likened it to caring for each project as if it were a “baby.” Could you elaborate on that?\n\nYes, exactly! We approach each project with the same care and attention as if it were our own. Each site has its unique characteristics and challenges. We don’t just apply a one-size-fits-all solution; we carefully assess each situation to find the optimal camera placement and settings. While we have our standards, we’re always aiming to get the best possible results by considering the specific characteristics of each project. Our clients benefit from our commitment to treating each project with the utmost care and dedication.\n\nIt must be great to see how Evercam has evolved and the impact it’s had on clients. Do you have a memorable project that stands out?\n\nDefinitely. When I first started, there was a camera with a lot of issues—hardware, processing, recording, you name it. After several meetings and six months of troubleshooting, that same camera’s data became a benchmark example of success to use as a demo for clients. It was a moment of validation for the whole team. We went from struggling with a problematic setup to having it serve as a successful demo, and it showed us what we’re capable of when working together.\n\nThere are quite a few success stories . One client discovered they had unauthorized activities at night using our 24/7 cameras. This was a huge benefit for them! Another client used our data to resolve a dispute with a supplier, which they won thanks to the information we provided. Another client who had specific site restrictions used our platform to confirm they were compliant with guidelines. These success stories highlight the value of construction cameras for our clients.\n\nLet’s talk about your mentorship efforts. You’re passionate about supporting Algerian women in science. Can you share more about what you’re doing in this area?\n\nMentorship is one of my passions. It’s my source of strength. I started a small group that has grown into what we call “Professional Gossips.” It began with me sharing job opportunities and advice with my mentees, but it has evolved into a larger community with other mentors joining in. We discuss various topics, from job applications to industry-specific insights, all in a relaxed, supportive environment. What I love most is how we combine learning with informal, enjoyable conversations, often over coffee. It’s about making the learning process as engaging and accessible as possible.\n\nThat sounds like a vibrant and supportive community. How do you balance your role at Evercam with your personal interests and mentorship activities?\n\nIt’s all about time management. I’m the team lead for the DQ team in Africa, a master’s student in management, and I mentor my group of mentees. I’m very strict with my time, and I expect my mentees to be equally committed. I believe in maximizing the value of our time together, so I encourage them to be proactive and disciplined. The Professional Gossip sessions usually happen once a week, either on weekends or late evenings, depending on everyone’s availability.\n\nWhen it comes to diversity and inclusion, how do you see the role of women evolving in traditionally male-dominated fields like tech and oil and gas?\n\nThis is a crucial and complex issue. I’ve experienced firsthand how challenging it can be for women in male-dominated fields. My advice to women is to believe in their abilities and continuously strive to be so good that they can’t be ignored. It’s about mastering your craft and demonstrating your value through your work. While diversity and inclusion initiatives are important, they should be coupled with real, practical support for women, tailored to their needs and strengths. It’s not enough to just promote gender equality; we need to ensure that women are set up for success in a meaningful way.\n\nYou’ve shared some insightful points. When you’re not working or mentoring, what other activities do you enjoy?\n\nI love hiking and being in nature. I’m part of a hiking club where we explore different trails and landscapes. Hiking is my way of recharging and connecting with nature. I also enjoy walking around the city if I can’t get out to hike. It’s something simple, but it brings me a lot of joy and peace.\n\nAs we wrap up, could you share your thoughts on fostering innovation within your team at Evercam?\n\nInnovation is key to what we do. I encourage my team to learn from other teams and bring new ideas to the table. We hold weekly calls, during which I often invite members from other departments to share their insights. This cross-team collaboration helps keep everyone informed and open to new approaches. I also make sure my team feels comfortable suggesting changes or improvements. It’s important that they know their input is valued and that they’re an active part of our innovation process.\n\nConnect With Amina\n\nRecent Posts\nWhy Communication is the Foundation of Construction Safety\nWebinar Recap: Streamline Daily Site Operations\nTop Construction Time-lapses\nWebinar Recap: Technology Implementation in Construction\n2024: A Successful Journey to Complete Project Visibility\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nRelated Posts\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

This new mixed-use vertical community acts as a connection point for downtown Raleigh.  400H brings together the best of retail, office, and residential functions at a centralized amenity level. Communal amenity spaces provide a range of activities for occupants and are larger and more well-appointed than traditional separate amenity spaces. Ground-floor retail benefits from heavy pedestrian foot traffic, while easy access to main streets is attractive to Class-A office tenants.\n\nThe tower’s design blends these uses together vertically, yielding a taller and more slender building with all the benefits of a cohesive community. The project size is approximately 560,000 SF with 144,000 SF of Class-A office space, 16,000 SF of ground-floor retail, and 242 apartments. The 9th-floor sky-hub features an indoor-outdoor amenity center with a pool, fitness center, lounge, and meeting space. It is expected to be completed in the 2nd quarter of 2023.\n\nCGI for 400 Hillsborough Street.

With a focus on sustainability and operational excellence, Echelon aimed to minimize rework and enhance construction efficiency. Evercam’s comprehensive reality capture solutions, including site visibility, team communication, gate report and traffic control, 4D BIM, and drone view capabilities, effectively addressed these challenges, revolutionizing industry standards.\n\nBy providing live remote access and unifying visual construction data, Evercam’s platform significantly improved site visibility and streamlined team communication, resulting in reduced travel time and costs. The 24/7 full-frame-rate recording capability offered comprehensive documentation of the project, facilitating incident management, dispute resolution, and informed decision-making. Additionally, Evercam’s gate report helped with traffic control and optimized vehicle movements, eliminating overcharging, and substantially reducing the carbon footprint associated with vehicles at the construction site.\n\nThe integration of Evercam’s 4D BIM solution empowered the entire team with access to planning versus reality comparisons, enhancing flexibility and efficiency in the construction process. The remote measurement capability allowed for precise planning and execution, while the drone view feature provided an immersive 3D visualization of the construction site. Accurate measurements of distances, heights, and areas facilitated real-time project progress monitoring, timely issue identification, and improved communication within the team.\n\nBeyond operational efficiency, Echelon utilized Evercam’s resources, including professionally edited time-lapse videos, to effectively market the ongoing progress of the DUB10 project. These captivating clips condensed months of construction work, highlighting the project’s magnitude and precision. The successful implementation of Evercam’s reality capture solutions in the DUB10 project led to substantial benefits, including a significant reduction in rework, cost savings, environmental sustainability, compliance with local environmental planning commitments, and reduced idle time for heavy machinery and concrete trucks.\n\nThe DUB10 project serves as a pioneering example of the integration of advanced technology in data centre construction, with Evercam at the forefront of driving industry transformation. The successful outcomes achieved through the implementation of Evercam’s innovative reality capture solutions have set a new benchmark for efficiency, communication, and safety. As the project nears completion, the impact of Evercam’s solutions reinforces its role as a key partner for future advancements in the field, redefining the construction landscape.\n\nDownload this Case Study\nRecent Resources\nBIM Heroes Podcast Ep #15 - Bluebeam Technology\nBIM Heroes Podcast Ep #14 - State of Project Management Technology\nGrace Construction Management Company, LLC Invests in Construction Cameras to Improve Workflow\nHow SunCode Energy is Boosting Operations Using Jobsite Cameras for Live Project Oversight\nBIM Heroes Podcast Ep#13 - State of Sustainable Solutions\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Undertaken by a Fortune 500 company specialising in agricultural science and technology, the incorporation of Evercam has transformed the strategies related to safety protocols, inter-team communication, and overall project administration.\n\nGiven the pressing challenge of limited space in the project, the team strategically installed construction cameras across the site to overcome this constraint. As a result of this setup, the team gained the advantage of real-time visibility and monitoring capabilities, which improved the adherence to safety protocols and helped in managing incident resolution. Consequently, the strategic placement of the cameras not only addressed the challenge of spatial limitation but also enriched safety management processes.\n\n“The integration of Evercam’s reality capture technology was a game-changer for our SMART Lab project. It changed the way we approached safety, communication, and project monitoring. The enhanced visibility and real-time monitoring capabilities empowered us to prevent incidents and promptly resolve potential issues, leading to improved safety outcomes. Evercam has become an invaluable asset in our construction endeavours, and we highly recommend it to any company looking to elevate their projects to the next level.” ~Engineering Manager\n\nMoreover, the seamless integration of Evercam with the Procore project management software bolstered communication and collaboration across all project stakeholders. The shared access to project documents and an increase in monitoring capabilities resulted in substantial improvements in efficiency and productivity.\n\nThe quantifiable success of Evercam’s implementation is evident in key performance indicators. A marked decrease in safety incidents coupled with an increase in safety observations underscore the positive impact of Evercam’s reality capture solution. Financial metrics also demonstrate considerable cost savings arising from immediate issue detection and the prevention of expensive delays or reworks.\n\n \n\nDownload this Case Study\nRecent Resources\nBIM Heroes Podcast Ep #15 - Bluebeam Technology\nBIM Heroes Podcast Ep #14 - State of Project Management Technology\nGrace Construction Management Company, LLC Invests in Construction Cameras to Improve Workflow\nHow SunCode Energy is Boosting Operations Using Jobsite Cameras for Live Project Oversight\nBIM Heroes Podcast Ep#13 - State of Sustainable Solutions\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Handling communication among multiple stakeholders effectively was also a key concern for this project. Considering these challenges the stakeholders decided to use Evercam’s platform to improve construction monitoring, ensure comprehensive site visibility, and streamline progress reporting.\n\nModern Site Monitoring and Reporting with Evercam\n\nBefore Evercam, site visits were frequent and required significant travel. The clerk of works and the senior project manager made trips of up to 100 miles. Evercam’s live site visibility and automatic daily progress photos via SnapMails changed this process. Remote monitoring significantly reduced the need for physical visits. This real-time capability was particularly helpful for team members in Essex and London. It saved substantial time and travel costs.\n\n“The real-time monitoring capability of the camera system was particularly beneficial for team members who previously had to travel long distances. The use of the camera reduced the frequency of their visits, saving time and resources, while still keeping them well-informed about the project’s progress”\n\n~Council Senior Project Manager\n\nImproved Efficiency and Stakeholder Communication\n\nEvercam’s platform significantly streamlined reporting and presentation preparation. The ability to create custom time-lapse videos reduced the project manager’s preparation time by three hours per presentation. This enhancement improved the effectiveness of stakeholder meetings.\n\n \n\nReal-Time Visuals for Faster Decision-Making\n\nDuring construction, the team faced a delay in drainage works. Evercam’s real-time monitoring allowed them to track progress and adjust schedules proactively. This kept the project on track and optimized resource use.\n\nThe drainage posed a concern for us due to a slight delay. However, we were able to monitor the situation before the delivery of the modular units, gaining insight into the current status and identifying where adjustments were needed within the next 10 days.\n~Ashana Jones \nCouncil Senior Project Manager\n\nReturn on Investment\n\nThe implementation of the Evercam system decreased the need for frequent site visits, saving both travel costs and time. Its capability to continue recording during power interruptions enhanced site security and aided law enforcement and insurance efforts, resulting in the recovery of stolen goods. Additionally, the system introduced efficiencies that saved the project team three hours per presentation, enhancing the quality and impact of stakeholder meetings. Overall, the estimated ROI from these improvements is £70,000.\n\nThe East London Forensic Centre project exemplifies how advanced technology like Evercam platform can transform project management in the construction industry, enhancing efficiency, security, and stakeholder communication.\n\nDownload This Case Study\nRecent Resources\nBIM Heroes Podcast Ep #15 - Bluebeam Technology\nBIM Heroes Podcast Ep #14 - State of Project Management Technology\nGrace Construction Management Company, LLC Invests in Construction Cameras to Improve Workflow\nHow SunCode Energy is Boosting Operations Using Jobsite Cameras for Live Project Oversight\nBIM Heroes Podcast Ep#13 - State of Sustainable Solutions\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

This advanced tool offers real-time, unbiased documentation, ensuring precision and efficiency in construction processes.\n\nDownload this Case Study\nChallenge\n\nConcrete pouring is a complex task with various factors influencing its success, including weather conditions, equipment arrangement, and adherence to quality standards. Disputes often arise regarding the concrete’s quality and whether it meets specified requirements. These disputes can lead to financial setbacks, delays, and a loss of trust among stakeholders.\n\nUsing reality capture technology as a solution\n\nReality capture technology has been integrated seamlessly into concrete pouring workflows to address these challenges. By employing drones to monitor site layouts and potential obstacles before pouring, real-time monitoring of weather conditions for precise timing, and construction cameras for quality control documentation during the pouring process, this technology provides an efficient and reliable solution. Furthermore, continuous monitoring during the curing stage, complemented by live-streaming options, enhances stakeholder engagement and allows for timely adjustments to maintain optimal curing conditions.\n\nResults\n\nTwo case studies exemplify the effectiveness of reality capture technology in resolving disputes and reinforcing trust in concrete pouring processes.\n\nCase Study 1: Resolving Substandard Concrete Quality Dispute\n\nIn a past project, a dispute arose over alleged substandard concrete quality. Reality capture, including time-lapse videos, was employed to comprehensively review the construction process. The captured data aided in identifying potential sources of defects and provided crucial evidence for resolution. This approach prevented a potential project setback and ensured adherence to quality standards.\n\nCase Study 2: Validating Concrete Pouring Best Practices\n\nDuring a concrete pour on the 5th floor of a construction project, concerns were raised about the concrete’s quality. Reality capture technology, specifically Evercam’s platform, was employed to showcase adherence to industry best practices through real-time, step-by-step validation of the pouring process. This comprehensive documentation dispelled doubts, prevented potential financial setbacks, and reinforced trust in the project’s quality and compliance.\n\n \n\nConclusion\n\nThe integration of reality capture technology in concrete pouring workflows is a significant advancement for the construction industry. It not only enhances efficiency and precision but also serves as a vital tool for conflict prevention and resolution.\n\nThrough real-time documentation and stakeholder engagement, reality capture technology fosters transparency and cooperation, significantly impacting the construction industry’s future by reducing disputes and ensuring project success.\n\nRecent Resources\nBIM Heroes Podcast Ep #15 - Bluebeam Technology\nBIM Heroes Podcast Ep #14 - State of Project Management Technology\nGrace Construction Management Company, LLC Invests in Construction Cameras to Improve Workflow\nHow SunCode Energy is Boosting Operations Using Jobsite Cameras for Live Project Oversight\nBIM Heroes Podcast Ep#13 - State of Sustainable Solutions\nRecent Projects\nThe Forum\nHoltville Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)\nGlass Bottle\nSimmons University\nSiemens Energy\nTC1 Cherrywood\nLogistiCenter® Warehouse\nEraring Power Station\nProject Groot\nEast London Forensic Centre\nAnalog Devices Research & Development Centre\nSouth Brooklyn Marine Terminal\nVaughan Park\nSparrows Point Park\nNorthern Light Acadia Hospital\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) represents a significant advancement in data protection laws, and Evercam is dedicated to ensuring that our products and services are fully compliant with GDPR requirements.\n\nUnderstanding data privacy requires familiarity with certain terms:\n\nData Subject: An individual whose personal data has been collected.\nData Processing: The operations performed on personal data, whether automated or manual.\nData Controller: The entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.\nData Processor: The entity that processes personal data on behalf of the Data Controller.\n\nIn simple terms, Evercam is the Data Processor and our Clients are the Data Controllers\n\nCompliance in Practice\n\nAs a Data Processor, Evercam diligently adheres to the key principles of the GDPR in the following ways:\n\nLawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency: A clear signage is placed on site to inform about the video capturing system in place.\nPurpose Limitation: Data is captured for legitimate interests such as Health & Safety and Project Management/Fraud Detection.\nData Minimisation: Field of view is focused on capturing the construction progress. Privacy Shields are applied to areas not related to construction activities. \nStorage Limitation: We store footage for typically 3 years due to construction liability periods. However, we follow our clients instructions on retention periods. \nIntegrity and Confidentiality: Access rights are restricted. Evercam acts only on written instructions.\nAccountability: We keep records of what data we have and where it is stored.\nGDPR FAQs\nDo Clients have the right to capture the data?\nWhat about consent?\nWhat is the biggest risk for the Client?\nCan a Client use the cameras for performance management of an individual?\nIs Evercam GDPR compliant?\nWhat about all the court cases of companies being fined?\nWhat about local legislation?\nWhat about other regions?\n\nAt Evercam, we are committed to adhering to these roles and complying with GDPR requirements, ensuring that our client’s data is securely handled and their rights are respected throughout the process. We strive to keep our Clients informed about the latest developments relating to the intersection between reality capture and data privacy.\n\nIt is important for the Data Controller and Data Processor to clearly understand their roles to ensure the protection of personal data. Misunderstanding or blurring these roles could lead to non-compliance with GDPR, resulting in severe penalties.\n\nOur goal is to build trust between businesses and individuals, fostering a data environment that respects privacy and promotes transparency.

The project involves the construction of 317 LEED-standard residential units, including a mix of studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom, and three-bedroom apartments. It also includes ground-floor retail spaces, private communal areas, and a rooftop terrace, covering a total area of 30,000 square meters.\n\nEvercam’s Contribution to Sustainable Urban Design\n\nSustainability was central to the Cherrywood development, which was designed to meet both WELL and BREEAM standards. Hines chose to partner with Evercam to monitor progress and the implementation of energy-efficient buildings, and resource management, to  minimize waste, rework and to ensure achievement of their sustainability goals.\n\nThe Importance of Construction Cameras in Cherrywood`s Project Management\n\nGiven the complexity of this project, maintaining real-time visibility and effective  remote project management was a priority. Evercam’s construction cameras proved essential in providing real-time sitemonitoring and documentation and ensuring all project stakeholders were kept up-to-date. Managing the construction of a project of this scale presented several challenges. These included coordinating multiple contractors, ensuring adherence to sustainability standards, and maintaining project timelines. The Hines team felt that partnering with Evercam would provide their project with the necessary visibility into the site’s daily activities.\n\nTime-Lapse Pro: Each month, Evercam delivered professionally edited time-lapse videos of the Cherrywood project in 4K resolution. These videos provided a clear and engaging visual narrative of its progress. This was invaluable for documenting milestones and keeping project stakeholders informed. The time-lapse videosalso provided ready-to-use content for social media and marketing campaigns, making it easy to showcase the project’s progress.\n\nLive View: Evercam’s Live View feature supplied Hines and its stakeholders with real-time visibility into the site’s construction activities. This continuous transparency improved collaboration, informed decision-making, and enabled more efficient project management. With immediate access to live footage, the Hines team could promptly address issues and monitor progress. This ensured that the project adhered to the established timeline and budget.\n\nTake a look below at the progress of the project from Apr 2021 Apr 2023 as captured by Evercam construction cameras\n\nAs Cherrywood now moves into its operational phase, the development serves as a model for future urban projects. It demonstrates how advanced construction management tools like Evercam can enhance efficiency. These tools ensure that builders complete large-scale developments on time and within scope.\n\nLearn More\n\nProject Details\nOwner\t\n\nHines Real Estate Ireland Limited\n\n\nProject Type\t\n\nResidential\n\n\nCity\tDublin\nCountry\tIreland\nPublished Date\t09-25-2024\nRecent Projects\nBook a demo\nContact\n\n6-7 Granby Row, Dublin 1, Ireland\n+353 1 919 4500\n\n\n\nOther Locations\nIE\nUK\nSG\nAU\nUS\nPL\nConstruction Cameras\nCamera Specs\nProjects\nPricing\nTutorials\nBlog\nResources\nE-books\nCase Studies\nReality Capture\nSitemap\nProductivity\nSoftware Integrations\nProject Management\nMarketing\nA.I. for Construction\nAbout\nTerms & Conditions\nGDPR compliance\nTrust Center\nAbout\nContact Us\nCareers\nTestimonials\nPartners\nBecome An Installer\nFind An Installer\nFeatures\nTime-lapse\nLive View\nRecordings\nGate Report\nX-Ray\nBIM Integration\nDrones in Construction\nProgress Photos\nZoom\nCompare Tool\nMark-up Tool\nGoogle Play\n \nApple Store\n\n \nWhatsApp\n \nGithub\n \nLinkedin\n \nTwitter\n \nFacebook\n \nVimeo\n \nYoutube\n \nInstagram"

Spanning approximately 37.2 acres, this initiative aims to convert a former industrial site into a vibrant, sustainable city quarter that seamlessly connects Dublin to the bay and links the neighboring communities of Irishtown, Ringsend, and Sandymount.\n\nThe development will deliver over 3,800 residential units, including private, social, affordable, and rental housing options, accommodating up to 9,500 residents. Complementing the residential spaces, the project will feature over one million square feet of commercial space, encompassing offices, retail outlets, hotels, cultural and community facilities, leisure amenities, and expansive public spaces.\n\nThe design emphasizes sustainability, incorporating low-carbon, highly efficient buildings throughout the development cycle. The initial phase, approved in March 2022, includes 570 apartments and 400 square meters of retail space, with subsequent phases adding more residential units and amenities. Construction began in June 2023, with the first completions expected by the end of 2025.\n\nBy revitalizing this historic area, the Glass Bottle project aspires to create a well-balanced community and a new destination for Dublin, offering residents and visitors a harmonious blend of urban living and natural beauty.\n\nHighlights:\nPart of the Poolbeg West Strategic Development Zone\nTransformation of a former industrial site into a mixed-use urban quarter\nDevelopment includes residential units, commercial spaces, cultural and community facilities\nEmphasis on sustainability with low-carbon, highly efficient buildings\nIntegration of public spaces connecting Dublin city to the bay\nProject Details\nGeneral Contractor\t\n\nJohn Sisk & Son\n\n\nOwner\t\n\nPembroke Ventures DAC\n\n\nProject Type\t\n\nMixed-Use Development\n\n\nSize\t\n\nApproximately 37.2 acres (15 hectares)\n\n\nCity\tDublin\nCountry\tIreland\nPublished Date\t02-13-2025\nRecent Projects\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Evercam has proven to be an indispensable tool for monitoring, communication, and visibility. Working with Evercam has been a fantastic experience.”\n\nRead The Full Story\n\nCody Whielock , Virtual Construction Manager, CM-BIM\n\nShared Innovation\n\n“It’s great for providing our clients with transparency\nand keeping them updated 24/7”\n\nRead The Full Story\n\nJay Cheung, Marketing Director Bartra.\n\nStories From Around The World\n\"I was very impressed with the Evercam experience from the set up and relocation of the timelapse camera to the support team who were always on hand to assist. The software itself was extremely user-friendly and easy to navigate once shown all the functionalities and features by the Customer Success team. The access it gave our project team was also very beneficial during the project delivery.\"\nGreer Baird\nMarketing Manager\n\"Multiplex had the opportunity to employ the use of Evercam time-lapse cameras since the start of 2022 on the Mosman High School Upgrade project. This has provided several benefits not only for the business, but also for the project stakeholders. The time-lapse cameras allow the business to provide stakeholders with a sense of exclusivity and grandeur, witness the new school Building G grow from ground up, and understand the story of the whole construction methodology. We’re also able to update stakeholders on the project progress and monitor the progress of all works and events that are occurring on site.\"\nJonathan Wang\nMultiplex\n\"With the Evercam system, we were able to provide visible 'proof of application' of our latest innovation: potatoes with very high levels of resistance against the Late Blight disease, grown from hybrid true potato seed in a test-field in Ireland. The system gave us all the tools we needed to remotely monitor the growth process from our offices in Holland, and provide the ultimate marketing materials to show the world how our innovative products can withstand the toughest conditions in the field. We were pleasantly surprised by the ease of use of the Evercam software, which gave us the opportunity to follow the progress in the field on a daily basis and download relevant footage for marketing- and management information purposes. Thanks for your support, Evercam Team!\"\nCaroline Elias\nMarketing & Communications - Solynta\n\"Evercam has been working with Fortis for SGA project for a couple years.

Once your project is complete, you may still need access to this very important data for various reasons such as: reporting, audits, law suits or data mining for construction intelligence that will benefit future projects. However, keeping all your project data accessible in real time can be costly, therefore Project Archiving allows you to balance your need for access with cost-effective storage options, ensuring you have the right level of control without unnecessary expenses.\n\nArchiving Options\n\nWhen your project finishes, you have a number of options for how your data will be managed. Here’s a breakdown of the choices you can make:\n\n\t\n\nFull Archive\n\n\t\n\nPartial Archive\n\n\t\n\nMinimal Archive\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nAll of your project video, images, and data are securely stored by Evercam. No data is deleted.\n\n\t\n\nCritical (but not all) project video, images, and data are securely stored by Evercam. Much of the project data is permanently deleted and cannot be retrieved.\n\n\t\n\nMinimal project video, images, and data are securely stored by Evercam. The majority of the project data is permanently deleted and cannot be retrieved.\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Requirements…\n\n\t\nLong-term data retention\nProtection against construction defects\nProtection against potential legal claims\nTraining and Upskilling\nComprehensive project knowledge\nProject and Portfolio insights\n\t\nRetention of essential data for periodic analysis\nA balance of cost savings with core data access\n\t\nDo not require data post-project\n\n\n\nData Retention & Access:\nHigh-Resolution Images\n\n\t\n\nAll of the high-resolution images captured during the project are retained and are available immediately via the Evercam platform.\n\nWe retain 100% of the images, which could be up to 1 image every 5 seconds, depending on your plan.\n\n\t\n\nThe critical high-resolution images captured during the project are retained and are available immediately via the Evercam platform.\n\nWe retain 1 image per hour. All excess images are deleted and cannot be retrieved.\n\n\t\n\nA minimal number of high-resolution images captured during the project are retained and are available immediately via the Evercam platform.\n\nWe retain 1 image per day. All excess images are deleted and cannot be retrieved.\n\n\n\n\nData Retention & Access:\nHigh-Resolution Video\n\n\t\n\nAll full-framerate video data is retained is available upon request, accessible within 2 days\n\n\t\n\nAll full-framerate video data is deleted and cannot be retrieved\n\n\t\n\nAll full-framerate video data is deleted and cannot be retrieved\n\n\n\n\nData Retention & Access:\nMedia Hub Assets\n\n\t\n\nAll Media Hub data is retained and is available immediately via the Evercam platform\n\n\t\n\nAll Media Hub data is retained and is available immediately via the Evercam platform\n\n\t\n\nAll Media Hub data is retained and is available immediately via the Evercam platform\n\n\n\n\nData Retention & Access:\nOther Project Data\n\n\t\n\nAll Other project-data is retained and is available immediately via the Evercam platform\n\n\t\n\nAll Other project-data is retained and is available immediately via the Evercam platform\n\n\t\n\nAll Other project-data is retained and is available immediately via the Evercam platform\n\n\n\n\nAPI Access\n\n\t\n\nYes (chargeable)\n\n\t\n\nNo\n\n\t\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nPossible to add more data to the project?\n\n\t\n\nNo\n\n\t\n\nNo\n\n\t\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nFull-framerate video clip requests\n\n\t\n\nYes\n\n\t\n\nNo (Full-framerate video clips are deleted)\n\n\t\n\nNo (Full-framerate video clips are deleted)\n\n\n\n\nExport all your data\n\n\t\n\nYes\n\n\t\n\nYes\n\n\t\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Storage Retrieval from Site by Evercam (when the storage device on-site is full and/or on project completion)\n\n\t\n\nChargeable (POA)\n\n\t\n\nChargeable (POA)\n\n\t\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nIncluded with an Enterprise Agreement or MSA\n\n\t\n\nYes\n\n\t\n\nN/A\n\n\t\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nArchive Pricing (commences once your project comes to completion)\n\n\t\n\nSee our pricing list\n\n\t\n\nSee our pricing list\n\n\t\n\nSee our pricing list\n\nHow to Choose an Option\n\nEvercam will notify you via an automated email when your project enters the post-live phase, marking the start of the 90-day period to select your project archiving option. You will receive a series of emails in the subsequent 90 days to remind you, if you have not already selected an option, to select your preference. You can simply reply to any of these automated emails specifying your data retention option of choice or reach out to your Customer Success Manager.\n\nWhat happens if a choice is not made?\n\nIf you don’t make a choice after your project is finished, your data will default to the Minimal Archive state after 90 days. If you have an Enterprise Account or Master Services Agreement (MSA) with Evercam, your data will default to the Full Archive state instead, giving you peace of mind that your critical data is safe and secure. if you wish for all of your project data to be retained you must let us know within 90 days of your project completion.\n\nFAQs\n \nWhat happens if I don’t select an option within 90 days?\n\nIf you don’t make a choice after your project is finished, your data will default to the Minimal Archive state after 90 days, meaning all of your data will be deleted. If you have an Enterprise Account or Master Services Agreement (MSA) with Evercam, your data will default to the Full Archive option instead, giving you peace of mind that your critical data is safe and secure.\n\nWhen does the 90-day countdown to select a Project Archiving option start?\n\nThe 90-day countdown begins the day you stop paying a software fee for that project.\n\nWill I be notified before my data is deleted?\n\nYes, you will be notified via an automated email when your project enters the post-live phase, marking the start of the 90-day period to select your data retention option. You will also receive a series of emails in the subsequent 90 days to remind you, if you have not already selected an option.\n\nHow do I select an option?\n\nYou can simply reply to the automated emails Evercam will send you in the 90-day period specifying your data retention option of choice or reach out to your Customer Success Manager.\n\nCan I request an extension to the 90-day period?\n\nThe 90-day period is a standard, automated process, however if you have special circumstances, please contact Evercam support at support@evercam.io to discuss your options.\n\nCan I switch between archiving options?\n\nYes, you can switch from Full to Partial at any time, however you cannot switch from Partial to Full, or from Minimal to Partial /Full because some/all your data will already have been deleted.\n\nIs my data secure in the ‘Full Archive’ and ‘Partial Archive‘ states?\n\nAbsolutely. We ensure your data is stored securely and remains accessible based on the option you choose.\n\nWhat data is retained in the ‘Full Archive’ option?\n\nAll of your data is retained in the Full Archive option. No project data is deleted.\n\nWhat data is deleted in the ‘Partial Archive’ option?\n\nAll of the full-frame-rate video is deleted. The high-resolution images are reduced in number to retain one image every hour throughout the history of your project – the excess images that were recorded during the Live phase will be deleted, and will no longer be accessible and cannot be recovered. All of the Media Hub data and other project data (e.g. Gate Report data, etc) is retained.\n\nWhat data is deleted in the ‘Minimal Archive’ option?\n\nNearly all of the data will be deleted in this option; only a minimal amount of data will be retained. All of the full-frame-rate video is deleted. The high-resolution images are reduced in number to retain one image every day throughout the history of your project – the excess images that were recorded during the Live phase will be deleted, and will no longer be accessible and cannot be recovered. All of the Media Hub data and other project data (e.g. Gate Report data, etc) is retained.\n\nWhat does it mean to ‘Export’ my project data?\n\nExporting your project data means you are downloading your data from the Evercam platform to store it yourself. This allows you to keep a copy of your project data independently.\n\nWhat is included when I export my data?\n\nThe export option gives you a comprehensive export of everything related to the project, meaning all of the high-resolution images, all of the full-frame-rate video, all of the Media Hub data and all of the other project data (e.g. Gate Report data, etc) and any other project details stored on the Evercam platform is included in the Export option.\n\nHow do I access my exported data?\n\nOnce you choose to export your data, Evercam will provide you with a secure download link and/or will post you a physical hard-drive. You will have 14 days to download your data from this link before it expires.\n\nCan I import my data back into Evercam after exporting it?\n\nYes, you can re-import your data into Evercam in the future for a fee. Once re-imported, you can choose to store the data using either the Full or Partial Archive options.\n\nIs there a cost to export my data?\n\nYes, there is a fee associated with exporting your data. Please refer to the pricing page on the Evercam website for detailed information on current costs.\n\nWhat happens to my data on Evercam after I export it?\n\nAfter you export your data, your project data will be retained according to the Archiving option you have chosen (Minimal Archive is default).\n\nWhat if I don’t download my data within the 14-day period?\n\nIf you do not download your data within the 14-day period, the download link will expire, and you will need to request a new export from Customer Success, which will incur an additional fee. Please make sure to download your data promptly to avoid additional charges.\n\nIs my exported data still secure?\n\nOnce exported, it is your responsibility to store your data securely. The data is no longer hosted on the Evercam platform, so you’ll need to ensure proper backup and security measures on your own systems.\n\nStill got Questions?\n\nIf you need assistance with Project Archiving, please reach out to our Customer Support team.
